{"pageid": 12818867, "ns": 0, "title": "Chaabou", "extract": "<p>According to the early Christian bishop Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 315\u2013403), <b>Chaabou</b> or <b>Kaabu</b> was a goddess in the Nabataean pantheon\u2014a virgin who gave birth to the god Dusares. However, Epiphanus likely mistook the word <i>ka'abu</i> (\"cube\", etymologically related to the name of the Kaaba), referring to the stone blocks used by the Nabateans to represent Dusares and possibly other deities, for the proper name of a goddess. His report that Chaabou was a virgin was likely influenced by his desire to find a parallel to the Christian belief in the virgin birth of Jesus, and by the similarity of the words <i>ka'bah</i> and <i>ka'ibah</i> (\"virgin\") in Arabic, a language closely related to that spoken by the Nabateans.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Palm tree symbol.svg"}]}

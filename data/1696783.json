Her cult is directly derived from Tantra where she is a symbol of sattva beside Durga and Kali, respectably symbolized with Rajas and Tamas.</p>\n<p>She is celebrated on Gosthastami. It is also referred to as another Durga Puja as it also starts on Asthami tithi and ends on Dashami tithi. The date of the puja is decided by the luni-solar Hindu calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Jagaddhatri is depicted as being the colour of the morning sun, three-eyed and four-armed, holding a chakra, conch, bow and arrows, clothed in red, bright jewels and <i>nagajangopaveeta</i> (a serpent as the sacred thread), a symbol of yoga and the Brahman. She rides a lion standing on the dead Karindrasura, the Elephant Demon. \"Jagaddhatri arises in the heart of a person,\" said Ramakrishna, \"who can control the frantic elephant called mind.\"</p>\n<p>Though she is worshipped all over West Bengal and some places of Odisha, Jagaddhatri Puja in Chandannagar, Krishnanagar, Boinchi, Bhadreswar, Hooghly, Rishra, Tehatta, Ashoknagar Kalyangarh, and Baripada, have a special socio-cultural celebration. In Kolkata, too, Jagaddhatri Puja is a major autumnal Hindu event after Durga Puja and Kali Puja. In Ramakrishna Mission, Jagaddhatri Puja was initiated by Sarada Devi, Ramakrishna\u2019s wife and observed in the centres of the Mission all over the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>Generally, Jagaddhatri is referred as another name of Durga. In Sanskrit, Bengali and Assamse the word 'Jagaddhatri' literally means 'Holder (dhatri) of the World (Jagat)' . According to Sri Ramakrishna, \u201c(Jagaddhatri) holds the World. If she wouldn\u2019t, the World might fall down. This explanation can be applied for both Durga and Jagaddhatri. That is why in the hymns, the goddess is always referred to as \u2018Jagaddhatri Durga -</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>\u099c\u09af\u09bc\u09a6\u09c7 \u099c\u0997\u09a6\u09be\u09a8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c7 \u099c\u0997\u09a6\u09c7\u0995 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09aa\u09c2\u099c\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7\u0964<br>\n\u099c\u09af\u09bc \u09b8\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09cd\u09ac\u0997\u09a4\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c1\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c7 \u099c\u0997\u09a6\u09cd\u09a7\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09bf \u09a8\u09ae\u09cb\u09bd\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 \u09a4\u09c7\u0965</p>\n<p><b>Transliteration</b>:</p>\n<p>Ja\u1e8fad\u0113 jagad\u0101nand\u0113 jagad\u0113ka prap\u016bjit\u0113\u0964<br>\nJa\u1e8fa sarwagat\u0113 durg\u0113 jagad'dh\u0101tri nam\u014d\u0315stu t\u0113\u0965</p>\n<p><b>Translation</b>: I hail Thee, o all-pervasive Jagaddhatri Durga, Thou art victorious and symbol of the joys of the world; it is only Thou in the world, who can be worshipped properly. Victory to Thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like most of other Hindu deities, Jagaddhatri is also known with other names like Karindrasuranisudini (Slayer of the Elephant Demon), Maheswari (the Great Goddess), Shaktacharpriya (the Goddess who loves to be worshiped in accordance to the practices of the Sakta sect of Hinduism, or Shaktism), Adharabhuta (the Bearer of the World) etc.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pauranik_lore\">Pauranik lore</span></h2>\n\n<p>As per ancient Pauranik lore of the Hindu scriptures, soon after the victory over Mahishasur the Devatas became highly egoistic. They thought because of lending to Durga their instruments the mighty asuras were vanquished. To make them understand that the primordial power is alone behind every action, then Para Brahma appeared before the Devatas in the form of effulgent Yaksha.</p>\n<p>Bewildered by its presence one by one the Devatas approached Yaksha. First the god of wind Vayu. The Yaksha asked him what he could do. The Vayu replied that he could throw away huge trees, tumble high mountains. The Yaksha then placed a small grass and asked him to move it. The Vayu utilised all his powers but lo! he could not even displace it. So also the god of fire Agni, could not even burn it. Likewise one by one the Devatas failed.</p>\n<p>And it dawned on them that their powers are in reality not their own but derived from the supreme power who as protecting mother holds the entire creation and therefore called Jagaddhatri. Anybody who worships Jagaddhatri becomes absolutely egoless and a true servant of the world which is nothing but a manifestation of the Brahman.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n<p>The <b>Jagadharti Puja</b> was first started by Maharaja Krishnachandra of Krishnanagar, Nadia in Bengal. Jagadhatri Puja is very popular in Krishnanagar, Rishra, Chandannagar, Bhadreswar, Hooghly, Boinchi. In krishnagar, nadia Burimar Jagadhatri Puja is one of the oldest jagadhtri Puja in Bengal. Because Maharaja Krishnachandra was inspired by this puja. Pimarily this puja was done by one old woman called 'Burima' in Bengali language. Later the goddess was named after 'Burima'. Presently in krishnagar,Nadia more than 100 Jagadhatri puja is organized but the main attraction is still Burima.</p>\n<p>The Jagadhatri puja of Bose family, Palpara, deserves a special mention in this regard. The puja of this family initially used to be held in their ancestral home in Murshidabad. Folklore has it that this puja was started in 1788. The puja was later shifted to its present location in Chandannagar, where many of the family members now live. The exact history of the deity is unknown, but family records date it back to 1640.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of the festival in Chandannagar is mainly due to the collaborative conception between the French and Bengalis. Remarkable feature remaining its procession, second largest in the world after Rio de Janeiro's, with its magnificent lightings </p>\n<p>Jagaddhatri figures in the semi-historical fictional work 'Anandamath' written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, from which book the national song of India \"Vande Mataram\" is taken. In the novel, Kali, Durga and Jagaddhatri are depicted as three aspects of 'Bharat Mata' (Mother India) - Jagaddhatri as the mother used to be, Kali as the mother now is, Durga as the mother will be in future. The trio of goddesses are shown as the object of worship of a group of ascetics who form the protagonists of the story.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Jagadhatri_Mela\">Jagadhatri Mela</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>After <i>Ratha Yatra</i>, <i>Jagadhatri Mela</i> at Bhanjpur <i>Jagadhatri Podia</i>, is the biggest <i>mela</i> of Baripada, Odisha.

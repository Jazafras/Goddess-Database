{"pageid": 85412, "ns": 0, "title": "Liberalitas", "extract": "<p>In ancient Roman culture, <i><b>liberalitas</b></i> was the virtue of giving freely (from <i>liber</i>, \"free\"), hence generosity. On coins, a political leader of the Roman Republic or an emperor of the Imperial era might be depicted as displaying largess to the Roman people, with <i>liberalitas</i> embodied as a goddess at his side. The goddess <b>Liberalitas</b> appears on coinage issued under the emperors Gordian III Trajan, Antoninus Pius and Septimius Severus, sometimes designated as <i>Augusta</i> or <i>Augusti</i> in association with Imperial cult. On one example, a Roman holds out his toga to receive coins poured by Liberalitas, as Antoninus looks on from an elevated seat.</p>\n<p>The divine Virtues are sometimes associated with a particular activity or function performed by the emperor\u2014in the case of Liberalitas, the <i>congiarium</i> or giving of gifts by the emperor directly to individuals. The enacting of the particular virtue was considered an epiphany of the goddess or <i>miraculum</i>: Liberalitas was thought to have manifested herself when Trajan distributed cash gifts to the populace during his formal arrival ceremony <i>(adventus)</i> in 99 AD. Pliny names the quality of <i>liberalitas</i> in his <i>Panegyric</i> to Trajan.</p>\n<p>Liberalitas was theologically linked to Providentia, \"providence\", and Annona, the embodiment of the grain supply.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aureus Macrinus-RIC 0079.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}]}

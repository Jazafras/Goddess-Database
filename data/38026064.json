She is described as the most beautiful courtesan in the city of Luoyang and a reincarnation of Peony fairy.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Legends\">Legends</span></h2>\n<p>White Peony's most popular legend comes from the novel <i>Journey to the East</i>. It is said that one day, the immortal L\u00fc Dongbin took a walk in Luoyang spotted White Peony, and was heavily attracted by her beauty. L\u00fc Dongbin then transformed himself into a handsome scholar and slept with her many times. However, in accordance with Taoist alchemy, he never ejaculated, in order to preserve his Yang essence. Unfortunately, Lu\u2019s immortal colleague Iron-Crutch Li and He Xiangu taught Mudan how to make him ejaculate by tickling his groin. Finally, White Peony successfully made L\u00fc Dongbin ejaculate and absorbed his Yang essence. Later she cultivated herself and became immortal as well.</p>\n<p>Feijianji, another novel from the Ming Dynasty  had a slightly different version of this legend. According to Feijianji, Bai Mudan was a common girl (not a prostitute) who was seduced by L\u00fc Dongbin. Later she became very weak since Lu practiced \"cai yin bu yang\"  on her. Meaning he absorbed her yin (female) essence, without losing his own yang (male) essence. When her mother consulted with Buddhist Monk Huanglong (Yellow Dragon), he taught her how to make L\u00fc Dongbin ejaculate and thus restore her yin essence. This event enraged L\u00fc Dongbin, he tried to decapitate Huanglong using his flying sword but failed. In the end Lu admitted his mistakes and acknowledged Huang Long as his teacher.</p>\n<p>In another story White Peony was ordered by the minister Su Dongpo (Su Shi), to tempt his friend, monk Fo Yin. Actually Su Shi hated Buddhist practitioners because he thought of unmarried monks as not sufficiently devoted to their ancestors.</p>\n<p>There is also a folktale from Song Dynasty which describes her as a haughty courtesan, who liked to humiliate her wealthy clients. Stories include asking them to kiss her butt. When a greedy merchant named Chen Hua was licking her anus, she even farted in his face Actually this is an allusion for Chen Hua's \"duo tun peng pi\" (\u6387\u81c0\u6367\u5c41) behavior. Duo tun peng pi is a Chinese idiom for flattering.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"As_goddess\">As goddess</span></h2>\n<p>Her reputation as seducer makes White Peony aka Bai Mudan deified as goddess who tempts men or more specifically an ascetic.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_popular_culture\">In popular culture</span></h2>\n<ul><li>White Peony appeared in many classic novels such as Journey to the East (\u4e1c\u6e38\u8bb0), Ba Xian Dedao (\u516b\u4ed9\u5f97\u9053), Fei Jian Ji, Han Xiangzi Quanzhuan-The Story of Han Xiangzi: The Alchemical Adventures of a Daoist Immortal (\u97d3\u6e58\u5b50\u5168\u50b3) and others.</li>\n<li>She is also a protagonist in a famous opera title; L\u00fc Dongbin san xi Bai Mudan (L\u00fc Dongbin three trick on White Peony).

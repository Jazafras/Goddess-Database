{"pageid": 3781758, "ns": 0, "title": "Triple deity", "extract": "<p>A <b>triple deity</b> (sometimes referred to as threefold, tripled, triplicate, tripartite, triune or triadic, or as a trinity) is three deities that are worshipped as one. Such deities are common throughout world mythology; the number three has a long history of mythical associations. Carl Jung considered the arrangement of deities into triplets an archetype in the history of religion.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Triple_goddesses\">Triple goddesses</span></h2>\n\n<p>In religious iconography or mythological art, three separate beings may represent either a triad who always appear as a group (Greek Moirai, Charites, Erinyes; Norse Norns; or the Irish Morr\u00edgna) or a single deity known from literary sources as having three aspects (Greek Hecate, Diana Nemorensis). In the case of the Irish Brigid it can be ambiguous whether she is a single goddess or three sisters, all named Brigid. The Morr\u00edgan also appears sometimes as one being, and at other times as three sisters, as do the three Irish goddesses of sovereignty, \u00c9riu, F\u00f3dla and Banba.</p>\n\n<p>The Matres or Matronae are usually represented as a group of three but sometimes with as many as 27 (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) inscriptions. They were associated with motherhood and fertility. Inscriptions to these deities have been found in Gaul, Spain, Italy, the Rhineland and Britain, as their worship was carried by Roman soldiery dating from the mid 1st century to the 3rd century AD. Miranda Green observes that \"triplism\" reflects a way of \"expressing the divine rather than presentation of specific god-types. Triads or triple beings are ubiquitous in the Welsh and Irish mythic imagery\" (she gives examples including the Irish battle-furies, Macha, and Brigit). \"The religious iconographic repertoire of Gaul and Britain during the Roman period includes a wide range of triple forms: the most common triadic depiction is that of the triple mother goddess\" (she lists numerous examples).</p>\n<p>Peter H. Goodrich interprets the literary figure of Morgan le Fay as a manifestation of a British triple goddess in the medieval romance <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>. A modern idea of a Triple Goddess is central to the new religious movement of Wicca.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Indo-European_theory\">Indo-European theory</span></h2>\n<p>Georges Dum\u00e9zil's trifunctional hypothesis proposed that ancient Indo-European society conceived itself as structured around three activities: worship, war, and toil. In later times, when slave labor became common, the three functions came to be seen as separate \"classes\", represented each by its own god. Dum\u00e9zil understood this mythology as reflecting and validating social structures in its content: such a tripartite class system is found in ancient Indian, Iranian, Greek and Celtic texts. In 1970 Dum\u00e9zil proposed that some goddesses represented these three qualities as different aspects or epithets and identified examples in his interpretation of various deities including the Iranian An\u0101hit\u0101, the Vedic Sarasvat\u012b and the Roman Juno.</p>\n<p>Vesna Petreska posits that myths including trinities of female mythical beings from Central and Eastern European cultures may be evidence for an Indo-European belief in trimutive female \"spinners\" of destiny. But according to the linguist M. L. West, various female deities and mythological figures in Europe show the influence of pre-Indo-European goddess-worship, and triple female fate divinities, typically \"spinners\" of destiny, are attested all over Europe and in Bronze Age Anatolia.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Classical_antiquity\">Classical antiquity</span></h2>\n<p>At her sacred grove at Aricia, on the shores of Lake Nemi a triplefold Diana was venerated from the late sixth century BCE as Diana Nemorensis. Andreas Alf\u00f6ldi interpreted a late Republican numismatic image as the Latin Diana \"conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess and the goddess of the nether world, Hekate\". This coin shows that the triple goddess cult image still stood in the <i>lucus</i> of Nemi in 43 BCE. The Lake of Nemi was <i>Triviae lacus</i> for Virgil (<i>Aeneid</i> 7.516), while Horace called Diana <i>montium custos nemoremque virgo</i> (\"keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi\") and <i>diva triformis</i> (\"three-form goddess\"). Diana is commonly addressed as Trivia by Virgil and Catullus.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Greek_magical_papyri\">Greek magical papyri</span></h3>\n<p>Spells and hymns in Greek magical papyri refer to the goddess (called Hecate, Persephone, and Selene, among other names) as \"triple-sounding, triple-headed, triple-voiced..., triple-pointed, triple-faced, triple-necked\". In one hymn, for instance, the \"Three-faced Selene\" is simultaneously identified as the three Charites, the three Moirai, and the three Erinyes; she is further addressed by the titles of several goddesses. Translation editor Hans Dieter Betz notes: \"The goddess Hekate, identical with Persephone, Selene, Artemis, and the old Babylonian goddess Ereschigal, is one of the deities most often invoked in the papyri.\"</p>\n<h3><span id=\"19th_century_classical_scholarship\">19th century classical scholarship</span></h3>\n<p>E. Cobham Brewer's 1894 <i>Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable</i> contained the entry, \"Hecate: A triple deity, called Phoebe or the Moon in heaven, Diana on the earth, and Hecate or Proserpine in hell,\" and noted that \"Chinese have the triple goddess Pussa\". The Roman poet Ovid, through the character of the Greek woman Medea, refers to Hecate as \"the triple Goddess\"; the earlier Greek poet Hesiod represents her as a threefold goddess, with a share in earth, sea, and starry heavens. Hecate was depicted variously as a single womanly form; as three women back-to-back; as a three-headed woman, sometimes with the heads of animals; or as three upper bodies of women springing from a single lower body (\"we see three heads and shoulders and six hands, but the lower part of her body is single, and closely resembles that of the Ephesian Artemis\").</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Classical_triple_goddesses_in_literature\">Classical triple goddesses in literature</span></h2>\n<p>The trinity of Asia, Panthea (\"All-Goddess\") and the Nereid Ione have been seen to be contrasted ironically with the triad of the Furies in Shelley's <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> making a careful separation between the Jungian figures of the Terrible and Good Mother.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Finno-Ugric_triads\">Finno-Ugric triads</span></h2>\n<p>In the mythology of the S\u00e1mi, a triad of goddesses are responsible for childbirth and protecting children. S\u00e1hr\u00e1hkka, who lives in the fireplace, is responsible for pregnancy and the particular protector of girls. Juks\u00e1hkk\u00e1, who lives in the area of the back doors, is responsible for turning some children into boys while they are in the womb (there was a belief that all children are female at the outset). Uks\u00e1hkk\u00e1 guards the main doors, and is responsible for protecting all young children.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pre-Islamic\">Pre-Islamic</span></h2>\n<p>A pagan god was worshipped in pre-Islamic Arabia and Nabataea with a family of deities around him among which was a triad of goddesses called \"the three daughters of God\": al-Lat (\"Mother Goddess of prosperity\") Al-Uzza (\"Mighty one\") the youngest, and Manat (\"Fate\") \"the third, the other\". They were known collectively as the three cranes. The name al-Lat is known from the time of the histories of Herodotus in which she is named Alilat.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Triple_goddess_stone\">Triple goddess stone</span></h2>\n\n<p><b>Qudshu-Astarte-Anat</b> is a representation of a single goddess who is a combination of three goddesses: Qetesh (Athirat \"Asherah\"), Astarte, and Anat. It was a common practice for Canaanites and Egyptians to merge different deities through a process of syncretization, thereby, turning them into one single entity. This \"Triple Goddess Stone\", once owned by Winchester College, shows the goddess Qetesh with the inscription \"Qudshu-Astarte-Anat\", showing their association as being one goddess, and Qetesh (Qudshu) in place of Athirat.</p>\n<p>Religious scholar Saul M. Olyan (author of Asherah and the Cult of Yahweh in Israel), calls the representation on the Qudshu-Astarte-Anat plaque \"a triple-fusion hypostasis\", and considers Qudshu to be an epithet of Athirat by a process of elimination, for Astarte and Anat appear after Qudshu in the inscription.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Three-headed_deities\">Three-headed deities</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>In Hindu mythology, Trisiras and Dattatreya are explicitly tricephalous deities, but other instances of three-headedness are also found in Hindu iconography, for example in depictions of goddess Durga.</li>\n<li>The smaller Gallehus horn has a three-headed figure, holding an axe in its right hand and a rope tethered to the leg of a horned animal in the left.</li>\n<li>In Slavic mythology, the god Triglav, (literally meaning \"three-heads\") is a three-headed man, sometimes depicted with three goat heads.

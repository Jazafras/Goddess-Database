She is associated with midsummer and the sun, and is sometimes represented by a red mare. She is the daughter of Egobail, the sister of Aillen and/or Fennen, and is claimed as an ancestor by multiple Irish families. As the goddess of love and fertility, she had command over crops and animals and is also associated with agriculture.</p>\n<p>\u00c1ine is strongly associated with County Limerick. The hill of Knockainey (Irish: <span lang=\"ga\" xml:lang=\"ga\"><i>Cnoc \u00c1ine</i></span>) is named after her, and was site of rites in her honour, involving fire and the blessing of the land, recorded as recently as 1879. She is also associated with sites such as Toberanna (Irish: <span lang=\"ga\" xml:lang=\"ga\"><i>Tobar \u00c1ine</i></span>), County Tyrone; Dunany (Irish: <span lang=\"ga\" xml:lang=\"ga\"><i>Dun \u00c1ine</i></span>), County Louth; Lissan (Irish: <span lang=\"ga\" xml:lang=\"ga\"><i>Lios \u00c1ine</i></span>), County Londonderry; and <i>Cnoc \u00c1ine</i> near Teelin, County Donegal.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_Irish_mythology\">In Irish mythology</span></h2>\n<p>In early tales she is associated with the semi-mythological King of Munster, Ailill Aulom, who is said to have raped her, an assault ending in \u00c1ine biting off his ear, hence the name <i>Aulom</i> \"one-eared\". By Old Irish law, only an \"unblemished\" person can rule; by maiming him this way, \u00c1ine rendered him unfit to be king. As an embodiment of sovereignty, she can both grant and remove a man's power to rule. The descendants of Aulom, the E\u00f3ganachta, claim \u00c1ine as an ancestor.</p>\n<p>In other tales \u00c1ine is the wife of Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, known popularly as \"Iarl Gear\u00f3id\". Rather than having a consensual marriage, he rapes her (thought to be based on the story of Ailill Aulom), and she exacts her revenge by either changing him into a goose, killing him or both. The FitzGeralds thus claim an association with \u00c1ine; despite the Norman origins of the clan, the FitzGeralds would become known for being \"More Irish than the Irish themselves.\"</p>\n<p>In yet other versions of her myth, she is the wife or daughter of the sea god, Manann\u00e1n mac Lir. The feast of Midsummer Night was held in her honor. In County Limerick, she is remembered in more recent times as Queen of the Fairies.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Related_goddesses\">Related goddesses</span></h2>\n<p>\u00c1ine (Ir. \"brightness, glow, joy, radiance; splendour, glory, fame\") is sometimes mistakenly equated with Danu as her name bears a superficial resemblance to Anu.</p>\n<p>\"Aynia\", reputedly the most powerful fairy in Ulster, may be a variant of the same figure. \u00c1ine's hill is located in the heart of <i>Cnoc \u00c1ine</i> (Knockainy) in County Limerick, is the hill of the goddess Grian, <i>Cnoc Gr\u00e9ine</i>. Grian (literally, \"sun\") is believed to be either the sister of \u00c1ine, another of \u00c1ine's manifestations, or possibly \"Macha in disguise\". Due to \u00c1ine's connection with midsummer rites, it is possible that \u00c1ine and Grian may share a dual-goddess, seasonal function (such as seen in the Gaelic myths of the Cailleach and Brigid) with the two sisters representing the \"two suns\" of the year: \u00c1ine representing the light half of the year and the bright summer sun (<i>an ghrian mh\u00f3r</i>), and Grian the dark half of the year and the pale winter sun (<i>an ghrian bheag</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Byrne, Francis John, <i>Irish Kings and High-Kings</i>.

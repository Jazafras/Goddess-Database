Because of the anger in Hiranyakashipu's body and blood Lord Narsimha drunk on rage and could not be stopped. To calm him down, Lord Shiva came down as Sharabha, a bird-animal-human hybrid. Upon seeing this, Lord Narasimha created Gandaberunda, a two headed-bird that was Sarabeswara's opposite. Seeing this it was known that only Lakshmi can calm down vishnu avatar Narsimha. Everyone praised her as she calmed Narasimha down Some believe that in ancient time when two Rishis, Prathiyangira and Angiras, were meditating discovered a goddess through a Moola Mantra who was nameless. Later she privileged the rishis by naming her after them and hence she was called as Prathiyangara Devi. Narasimhi is another name of hers. 'Naran' means human and 'Simha' means lion, so she got named thus as she appears with a lion's face and a human body.In Sri Chakra or Sri_Yantra worship, she protects her devotees against all odds.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pratyangira_Devi_Homam_(Havan)\"></span><span id=\"Pratyangira_Devi_Homam_.28Havan.29\">Pratyangira Devi Homam (Havan)</span></h2>\n<p>Havan dedicated to Pratyangira devi is performed at many places for the welfare of the people and for eliminating the influences of evil forces.

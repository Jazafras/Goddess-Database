{"pageid": 69608, "ns": 0, "title": "V\u00f6r", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, <b>V\u00f6r</b> (Old Norse, possibly \"the careful one,\" or \"aware, careful\") is a goddess associated with wisdom. V\u00f6r is attested in the <i>Prose Edda</i>, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and twice in kennings employed in skaldic poetry. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n<p>In chapter 35 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Gylfaginning</i>, High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur. High lists V\u00f6r tenth, and says that V\u00f6r is \"wise and inquiring, so that nothing can be concealed from her.\" High adds that a saying exists where \"a woman becomes aware (<i>vor</i>) of something when she finds it out.\" In chapter 75 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i> V\u00f6r appears within a list of 27 \u00e1synjur names.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Theories\">Theories</span></h2>\n<p>Rudolf Simek says that it is uncertain whether or not V\u00f6r was a goddess as attested in the <i>Prose Edda</i> and if the etymological connection presented there (between <i>V\u00f6r</i> and Old Norse <i>v\u00f6rr</i>, meaning \"careful\") is correct. In the same work, Simek writes that the goddesses S\u00e1ga, Hl\u00edn, Sj\u00f6fn, Snotra, V\u00e1r, and V\u00f6r should be considered vaguely defined figures who \"should be seen as female protective goddesses\" that are all responsible for \"specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.\" Simek notes that the second part of the valkyrie name <i>Geirav\u00f6r</i> may be identical with the name of the goddess <i>V\u00f6r</i> (and would therefore mean \"spear-goddess\"), or simple be identical with a frequently found suffix appearing in personal names.</p>\n<p>Andy Orchard comments \"Snorri's etymologizing interpretation is scarcely profound, and may imply that he had no access to further material\" and notes that references to V\u00f6r are otherwise rare.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

{"pageid": 52560572, "ns": 0, "title": "Maliya", "extract": "<p><b>Maliya</b> is the Hittite goddess of gardens, often associated with the horse-god Pirwa and the goddess Kamru\u0161epa. All three gods are connected to horses. She was originally worshipped in southeastern Anatolia at Kani\u0161 and Kizzuwatna. She may originally be a Luwian goddess.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Role\">Role</span></h2>\n<p>Maliya is often attested with rivers and mountains as a recipient of offerings and was probably identical with the goddess of the Maliya river, whose cult statue was made of iron.</p>\n<p>In a vineyard ritual, the weather god Tar\u1e2bunna is invoked for the sake of the king's vineyard. Various pairs of gods are offered bread and animal sacrifices, including Tilipinu, who is paired with \"Maliya of the Garden, mother of wine and corn.\" In the city of I\u0161tanuwa, offerings were made to \"Maliya of the Horn.\"</p>\n<p>In healing rituals, Maliya is named along with the divine sorceress, Kamru\u0161epa. In one such ritual, she learns from Ishtar of a plague and reports it to Pirwa, who passes it on in turn to Kamru\u0161epa, who yokes her horses to her chariot and rides to the \"great river.\"</p>\n<p>Maliya was among the main deities of the nine-day i\u0161uwa-Fest, which was originally celebrated in Kizzuwatna to safeguard the royal family. Most of the gods involved in this festival belonged to the Hurrian pantheon. In the court of the temple of Maliya, the Hittite king bowed down before the divine horse Erama and offered it barley from an offering vessel.</p>\n<p>Together with Pirwa and other deities, Maliya appears in the cycle of the Song of Kani\u0161.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Maliyanni\">Maliyanni</span></h3>\n<p>The Maliyanni (\"Small Maliyas\") are a pair of gods which were worshipped in vineyards. According to the ritual of the sorceress Anna of Kaplawiya for remedying infertile vineyards, a pit should be dug in front of the Maliyanni and cakes thrown into it as offering. Significantly, this ritual includes a speech in an unknown language.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Onomastics\">Onomastics</span></h2>\n<p>Maliya appears as a component in Hittite place names and personal names. The oldest example comes from 18th century BC Assyrian documents from K\u00fcltepe, in which the female name Maliawa\u0161\u1e2bi appears frequently. With respect to place names, the city of Malliya\u0161\u0161i is significant, since it is formed in the same way as the cities of Tar\u1e2bunta\u0161\u0161a and Tiwata\u0161\u0161a (named after the Luwian weather god Tar\u1e2bunz and Sun god Tiwaz).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Later_history\">Later history</span></h2>\n<p>Maliya probably continued to be worshipped under various names during Classical Antiquity.</p>\n<p>In Lycia the goddess Malija was worshipped; she was identified with the Greek goddess Athena. Her epithet <i>hriuwama</i>, meaning \"the Empowerer\" suggests that she was a goddess of vegetation. The lexicographer Hesychius also equates Malis (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) with Athena, Theocritus mentions a nymph of the same name, and on the island of Lesbos, Malis (\u039c\u1fb6\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) was a spinning goddess like Athena. According to Hellanicus, Malis (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was a slave of the Lydian queen Omphale who had a child, Akeles, with Heracles. Finally, Sophocles refers to the Maliadian nymphes (\u039c\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ren\u00e9 Lebrun: \"Maliya, une divinit\u00e9 anatolienne mal connue\" in <i>Studia Paulo Naster Oblata: Orientalia antiqua</i>; Leuven (1982). pp. 123-130.</li>\n<li>Volkert Haas: <i>Geschichte der hethitischen Religion</i> (= <i>Handbuch der Orientalistik.</i> Band 1.15).

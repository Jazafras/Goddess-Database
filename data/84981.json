{"pageid": 84981, "ns": 0, "title": "Aequitas", "extract": "<p><i><b>Aequitas</b></i> (genitive <i>aequitatis</i>) is the Latin concept of justice, equality, conformity, symmetry, or fairness. It is the origin of the English word \"equity\". In ancient Rome, it could refer to either the legal concept of equity, or fairness between individuals.</p>\n<p>Cicero defined <i>aequitas</i> as \"tripartite\": the first, he said, pertained to the gods above <i>(ad superos deos)</i> and is equivalent to <i>pietas</i>, religious obligation; the second, to the Manes, the underworld spirits or spirits of the dead, and was <i>sanctitas</i>, that which is sacred; and the third pertaining to human beings <i>(homines)</i> was <i>iustitia</i>, \"justice\".</p>\n<p>During the Roman Empire, Aequitas as a divine personification was part of the religious propaganda of the emperor, under the name <i>Aequitas Augusti</i>, which also appeared on coins. She is depicted on coins holding a cornucopiae and a balance scale <i>(libra)</i>, which was more often a symbol of \"honest measure\" to the Romans than of justice.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Antoninianus Claudius II-RIC 0137.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Capitoline Wolf of Roman Kingdom.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}]}

{"pageid": 30865276, "ns": 0, "title": "Panacea", "extract": "<p>In Greek mythology, <b>Panacea</b> (Greek <i>\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1</i>, <b>Panakeia</b>) was a goddess of universal remedy. She was the daughter of Asclepius and Epione. Panacea and her four sisters each performed a facet of Apollo's art: Panacea (the goddess of universal health), Hygieia (\"Hygiene\" the goddess/personification of health, cleanliness, and sanitation), Iaso (the goddess of recuperation from illness), Aceso (the goddess of the healing process), and Agl\u00e6a/\u00c6gle (the goddess of beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence, and adornment).</p>\n<p>Panacea also had four brothers\u2014Podaleirus, one of the two kings of Tricca, who was skilled in diagnostics, and Machaon, the other king of Tricca, who was a master surgeon (these two took part in the Trojan War until Machaon was killed by Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons); Telesphoros, who devoted his life to serving Asclepius; and Aratus, her half-brother, who was a Greek hero and the patron/liberator of Sicyon.</p>\n<p>Panacea was said to have a poultice or potion with which she healed the sick. This brought about the concept of the panacea in medicine, a substance meant to cure all diseases. The term is also used figuratively as something intended to completely solve a large, multi-faceted problem.</p>\n<p>A river in Thrace/Moesia was named after the goddess, and is still known as the river Zlatna Panega (from Greek panakeia).</p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Panacea.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}]}

For the desert, see Cholistan Desert</i></dd>\n</dl><p>In a tradition of the Moriori people of the Chatham Islands, <b>Rohe</b> is the wife of the demi-god M\u0101ui. Beautiful Rohe was a sister of the sun, and her face shone. A quarrel arose after Rohe remarked that M\u0101ui's face was ugly. M\u0101ui then decided that they should change faces.</p>\n<p>Afterwards M\u0101ui used magic to kill Rohe, but her spirit returned and destroyed M\u0101ui. Thus were black magic and death introduced into the world. After her death, Rohe ruled as the goddess of the p\u014d (spirit world), where she gathered in the spirits of the dead. Evil influences were attributed to her (Best 1982:362-363, Shand 1897:125-126).</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cook_Islands\">Cook Islands</span></h2>\n<p>In Mangaia, the name <b>Ro'e</b> appears in <b>Te Aka-ia-Ro'e</b> (the root of all existence) which, according to Tregear, is 'a spirit in the form of a thick stem tapering to a point, and is situated at the bottom of the Universe, sustaining the Cosmos' (Gill 1976:1, Tregear 1891:421). According to Elsdon Best, the goddess exchanges heads with M\u0101ui (Best 1982:363).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"M\u0101ori\"></span><span id=\"M.C4.81ori\">M\u0101ori</span></h2>\n<p>The M\u0101ori knew little of <b>Rohe</b>. Tregear records the one myth associated with her, in which she is the wife of M\u0101ui. She was beautiful as he was ugly, and she refused his request to exchange faces. M\u0101ui, however, recited an incantation, and their faces were switched. In anger Rohe left him, and refused to live any longer in the world of light. She went to the underworld, and became a goddess of the p\u014d (night or spirit world). Rohe is said sometimes to beat the spirits of deceased as they pass through her realm. Her home is in that division of the night world called Te Uranga-o-te-r\u0101. M\u0101ui and Rohe had a son named Rangihore, the god of rocks and stones (Craig 1989:231, Best 1982:362, Tregear 1891:421). </p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tahiti\">Tahiti</span></h2>\n<p>In Tahiti, the 'Father of Famine' is called <b>Rohe-upo'o-nui</b>, (Large-headed Rohe) (Tregear 1891:421).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>E.

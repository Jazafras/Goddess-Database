She marries Conall Corc, founder of the E\u00f3ganachta dynasties, and through him is an ancestor of the \"inner circle\" septs of E\u00f3ganacht Chaisil, E\u00f3ganacht Glendamnach, and E\u00f3ganacht \u00c1ine, who established the powerful kingship of Cashel. Details of the story imply she may have originally been a goddess (Byrne 2001: 166, 193).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>This name appears to be derived from Proto-Celtic *<i>aidu-mand\u0101</i>. The name literally means \"burning stain,\" which may have been a byword for the notion of \u2018sunburn\u2019 (q.v. [1] [2] [3]). The Romano-British form of this Proto-Celtic name is likely to have been *<i>Aedumanda</i> (q.v. [4] [5] [6] [7]).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Francis John Byrne, <i>Irish Kings and High-Kings</i>.

Both the English word <i>east</i> and the Latin <i>auster</i> \"south wind, south\" are from a root cognate adjective <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*h\u2082ews-t(e)ro-</span></i>. Also related is <i>aurum</i> \"gold\", from <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*h\u2082e-h\u2082us-o-m</span></i>. The dawn goddess was also the goddess of spring, involved in the mythology of the Indo-European new year, where the dawn goddess is liberated from imprisonment by a god (reflected in the Rigveda as Indra, in Greek mythology as Dionysus and Cronus).</p>\n<p>Derivatives of <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*h\u2082\u00e9ws\u014ds</span></i> in the historical mythologies of Indo-European peoples include Indian <i>U\u1e63as</i>, Greek \u1f28\u03ce\u03c2 (<i>\u0112\u014ds</i>) and Latin <i>Aur\u014dra</i>, as well as Baltic <i>*Au\u0161r\u0101</i> (\"dawn\", cf. Lithuanian <i>Au\u0161rin\u0117</i>). Germanic <i>*Austr\u01ed</i> is from an extended stem <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*h\u2082ews-t(e)ro-</span></i>, although it could also be etymologically identical with Lithuanian <i>au\u0161ra</i> ~ dial. <i>au\u0161tra</i>, Latvian <i>austra</i> (both \"dawn\") and Proto-Slavic <i>*utro</i> ~ <i>*ustro</i> (\"morning\"), the <i>-t-</i> in Balto-Slavic clearly being secondary and due to epenthesis.</p>\n<p>The Italic goddess Mater Matuta \"Mother Morning\" has been connected to Aurora by Roman authors (Lucretius, Priscianus). Her festival, the <i>Matralia</i>, fell on 11 June, beginning at dawn.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Functions\">Functions</span></h2>\n<p>Besides the name most amenable to reconstruction, <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*h\u2082\u00e9ws\u014ds</span></i>, a number of epithets of the dawn goddess may be reconstructed with some certainty. Among these is <i>*w\u00e9nh\u2081os</i> (also an <i>s</i>-stem), whence Sanskrit <i>vanas</i> \"loveliness; desire\", used of U\u1e63as in the Rigveda, and the Latin name <i>Venus</i> and the Norse Vanir. The name indicates that the goddess was imagined as a beautiful nubile woman, who also had aspects of a love goddess.</p>\n<p>The love goddess aspect was separated from the personification of dawn in a number of traditions, including Roman Venus vs. Aurora, and Greek Aphrodite vs. Eos. The name of Aphrodite <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u0386\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7</span> may still preserve her role as a dawn goddess, etymologized as \"she who shines from the foam [ocean]\" (from <i>aphros</i> \"foam\" and <i>deato</i> \"to shine\"). J.P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams (1997) have also proposed an etymology based on the connection with the Indo-European dawn goddess, from <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*h\u2082eb\u02b0or-</span></i> \"very\" and <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*d\u02b0ey-</span></i> \"to shine\". Other epithets include \u1f28\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7 Erigone \"early-born\" in Greek.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Myths\">Myths</span></h2>\n<p>The abduction and imprisonment of the dawn goddess, and her liberation by a heroic god slaying the dragon who imprisons her, is a central myth of Indo-European religion, reflected in numerous traditions. Most notably, it is the central myth of the Rigveda, a collection of hymns surrounding the Soma rituals dedicated to Indra in the new year celebrations of the early Indo-Aryans.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Dawn goddess</li>\n<li>Earendel</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Janda, Michael, <i>Die Musik nach dem Chaos</i>, Innsbruck 2010,</li>\n<li>Mallory, J.

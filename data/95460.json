{"pageid": 95460, "ns": 0, "title": "Rangi and Papa", "extract": "<p>In M\u0101ori mythology the primal couple <b>Rangi and Papa</b> (or <b>Ranginui</b> and <b>Papat\u016b\u0101nuku</b>) appear in a creation myth explaining the origin of the world (though there are many different versions). In some South Island dialects, Rangi is called <b>Raki</b> or <b>Rakinui</b>.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Union_and_separation\">Union and separation</span></h2>\n<p>Ranginui and Papat\u016b\u0101nuku are the primordial parents, the sky father and the earth mother who lie locked together in a tight embrace. They have many children all of whom are male, who are forced to live in the cramped darkness between them. These children grow and discuss among themselves what it would be like to live in the light. T\u016bmatauenga, the fiercest of the children, proposes that the best solution to their predicament is to kill their parents (Grey 1956:2).</p>\n<p>But his brother T\u0101ne disagrees, suggesting that it is better to push them apart, to let Ranginui be as a stranger to them in the sky above while Papat\u016b\u0101nuku will remain below to nurture them. The others put their plans into action\u2014Rongo, the god of cultivated food, tries to push his parents apart, then Tangaroa, the god of the sea, and his sibling Haumia-tiketike, the god of wild food, join him. In spite of their joint efforts Rangi and Papa remain close together in their loving embrace. After many attempts T\u0101ne, god of forests and birds, forces his parents apart. Instead of standing upright and pushing with his hands as his brothers have done, he lies on his back and pushes with his strong legs. Stretching every sinew T\u0101ne pushes and pushes until, with cries of grief and surprise, Ranginui and Papat\u016b\u0101nuku were pried apart (Grey 1956:2-3, Biggs 1966:448).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"War_in_heaven_and_earth\">War in heaven and earth</span></h2>\n\n<p>And so the children of Ranginui and Papat\u016banuku see light and have space to move for the first time. While the other children have agreed to the separation T\u0101whirim\u0101tea, the god of storms and winds, is angered that the parents have been torn apart. He cannot bear to hear the cries of his parents nor see the tears of Ranginui as they are parted, he promises his siblings that from henceforth they will have to deal with his anger. He flies off to join Rangi and there carefully fosters his own many offspring who include the winds, one of whom is sent to each quarter of the compass. To fight his brothers, T\u0101whirim\u0101tea gathers an army of his children\u2014winds and clouds of different kinds, including fierce squalls, whirlwinds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery clouds, hurricane clouds and thunderstorm clouds, and rain, mists and fog. As these winds show their might the dust flies and the great forest trees of T\u0101ne are smashed under the attack and fall to the ground, food for decay and for insects (Grey 1956:3-6, Tregear 1891:54, Biggs 1966:448-449).</p>\n<p>Then T\u0101whirim\u0101tea attacks the oceans and huge waves rise, whirlpools form, and Tangaroa, the god of the sea, flees in panic. Punga, a son of Tangaroa, has two children, Ikatere father of fish, and Tu-te-wehiwehi (or Tu-te-wanawana) the ancestor of reptiles. Terrified by T\u0101whirim\u0101tea\u2019s onslaught the fish seek shelter in the sea and the reptiles in the forests. Ever since Tangaroa has been angry with T\u0101ne for giving refuge to his runaway children. So it is that T\u0101ne supplies the descendants of T\u016bmatauenga with canoes, fishhooks and nets to catch the descendants of Tangaroa. Tangaroa retaliates by swamping canoes and sweeping away houses, land and trees that are washed out to sea in floods (Grey 1971:5-6).</p>\n<p>T\u0101whirim\u0101tea next attacks his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike, the gods of cultivated and uncultivated foods. Rongo and Haumia are in great fear of T\u0101whirim\u0101tea but, as he attacks them, Papat\u016b\u0101nuku determines to keep these for her other children and hides them so well that T\u0101whirim\u0101tea cannot find them. So T\u0101whirim\u0101tea turns on his brother T\u016bmatauenga. He uses all his strength but T\u016bmatauenga stands fast and T\u0101whirimatea cannot prevail against him. T\u016b (or human kind) stands fast and, at last, the anger of the gods subsided and peace prevailed.</p>\n<p>T\u016b thought about the actions of T\u0101ne in separating their parents and made snares to catch the birds, the children of T\u0101ne who could no longer fly free. He then made nets from forest plants and casts them in the sea so that the children of Tangaroa soon lie in heaps on the shore. He made hoes to dig the ground, capturing his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike where they have hidden from T\u0101whirim\u0101tea in the bosom of the earth mother and, recognizing them by their long hair that remains above the surface of the earth, he drags them forth and heaps them into baskets to be eaten. So T\u016bmatauenga eats all of his brothers to repay them for their cowardice; the only brother that T\u016bmatauenga does not subdue is T\u0101whirim\u0101tea, whose storms and hurricanes attack humankind to this day (Grey 1971:7-10, Biggs 1966:449).</p>\n<p>There was one more child of Ranginui and Papat\u016b\u0101nuku who was never born and still lives in Papat\u016banuku's tummy. Whenever this child is kicking the earth shakes and it causes an earthquake. R\u016baumoko is his name and he is the God of earthquakes and volcanoes.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Yearning\">Yearning</span></h2>\n<p>T\u0101ne searched for heavenly bodies as lights so that his father would be appropriately dressed. He obtained the stars and threw them up, along with the moon and the sun. At last Ranginui looked handsome (Orbell 1998:145). Ranginui and Papat\u016banuku continue to grieve for each other to this day. Ranginui's tears fall towards Papat\u016banuku to show how much he loves her. Sometimes Papat\u016banuku heaves and strains and almost breaks herself apart to reach her beloved partner again but it is to no avail. When mist rises from the forests, these are Papat\u016b\u0101nuku's sighs as the warmth of her body yearns for Ranginui and continues to nurture mankind (Grey 1956:11).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Names_and_epithets\">Names and epithets</span></h2>\n<p><b>Ranginui</b></p>\n<ul><li>Rangi (\"Sky\")</li>\n<li>Raki (\"Sky\") in the South Island</li>\n<li>Ranginui (\"Great Sky\")</li>\n<li>Rangi-p\u014dtiki (\"Rangi the Lastborn\"): possibly another name of Rangi, or a closely allied deity</li>\n</ul><p><b>Papatuanuku</b></p>\n<ul><li>Papa (\"world\")</li>\n<li>Papat\u016b\u0101nuku (\"world separated\"), (Earth), (Mother Earth)</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Atea, husband of Papa (primordial parents) in Tuamotuan, Rarotongan and Marquesas genealogies</li>\n<li>W\u0101kea, husband of Papa, from Hawaii</li>\n<li>Vatea, husband of Papa, father of gods and men in Mangaia, Cook Islands</li>\n<li>Anu and Ki (goddess), Sumerian deities similar to Rangi and Papa</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>B.G.

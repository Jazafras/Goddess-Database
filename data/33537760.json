They also appear in Quich\u00e9 legends such as within the Popol Vuh. Some scholars, such as the Nicaraguan Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s claim that Cipactonal was actually the female and Oxomoco actually the male and referred to one of them as Tamagastad. Other scholars from the Nicaraguan perspective such as Ephraim George Squier and Frank E. Comparato also claim that Oxomoco was male and Cipactonal female and claim that they were sorcerers and magicians. Nahuatl terms of the four shamans who stayed at Tamoanchan are not gendered with the exception of Oxomoco who was female. In the <i>Codex Borbonicus</i>, Oxomoc, like Cipactonal, usually wears the tobacco gourd of priestson her back. In some depictions the goddess is wearing a butterfly mask and throwing maize and beans from a vessel. In the Florentine Codex, Oxomoco is depicted divining with knotted cords.

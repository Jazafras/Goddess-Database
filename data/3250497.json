Along with Ver\u00f0andi (possibly \"happening\" or \"present\") and Skuld (possibly \"debt\" or \"future\"), Ur\u00f0r makes up a trio of Norns that are described as deciding the fates of people. Ur\u00f0r is attested in stanza 20 of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>V\u00f6lusp\u00e1</i> and the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Gylfaginning</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Ur\u00f0r</i> is together with the Norns located at the well Ur\u00f0arbrunnr beneath the world ash tree Yggdrasil of Asgard. They spin threads of life, cut marks in the pole figures and measure people's destinies, which shows the fate of all human beings and gods. Norns are always present when a child is born and decide its fate. The three Norns represent the past (Ur\u00f0r), future (Skuld) and present (Ver\u00f0andi).</p>\n<p><i>Ur\u00f0r</i> is commonly written as <b>Urd</b> or <b>Urth</b>.

Her name is the equivalent of Latin <b>Discordia</b>, which means \"discord\". Eris' Greek opposite is Harmonia, whose Latin counterpart is Concordia. Homer equated her with the war-goddess Enyo, whose Roman counterpart is Bellona. The dwarf planet Eris is named after the goddess.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Characteristics_in_Greek_mythology\">Characteristics in Greek mythology</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Hesiod's <i>Works and Days</i> 11\u201324, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i> (226\u2013232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:</p>\n<dl><dd>And hateful Eris bore painful Ponos (\"Hardship\"),</dd>\n<dd>Lethe (\"Forgetfulness\") and Limos (\"Starvation\") and the tearful Algea (\"Pains\"),</dd>\n<dd>Hysminai (\"Battles\"), Makhai (\"Wars\"), Phonoi (\"Murders\"), and Androktasiai (\"Manslaughters\");</dd>\n<dd>Neikea (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudea (\"Lies\"), Logoi (\"Stories\"), Amphillogiai (\"Disputes\")</dd>\n<dd>Dysnomia (\"Anarchy\") and Ate (\"Ruin\"), near one another,</dd>\n<dd>and Horkos (\"Oath\"), who most afflicts men on earth,</dd>\n<dd>Then willing swears a false oath.</dd>\n</dl><p><br>\nThe other Strife is presumably she who appears in Homer's <i>Iliad</i> Book\u00a0IV; equated with Enyo as sister of Ares and so presumably daughter of Zeus and Hera:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has a son whom she named Strife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Enyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the Achaeans in Book 11, of the same work.</p>\n<p>The most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the Trojan War by causing the Judgement of Paris. The goddesses Hera, Athena and Aphrodite had been invited along with the rest of Olympus to the forced wedding of Peleus and Thetis, who would become the parents of Achilles, but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.</p>\n<p>She therefore (as mentioned at the <i>Kypria</i> according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and Themis) tossed into the party the Apple of Discord, a golden apple inscribed <i>\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3</i> (Ancient\u00a0Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\"><i>t\u0113(i) kallist\u0113(i)</i></span>) \u00a0\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"\u00a0\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless Paris, Prince of Troy, was appointed to select the fairest by Zeus. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris' decision, and also attempted to bribe him. Hera offered political power; Athena promised infinite wisdom; and Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, Paris chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.</p>\n<p>In Nonnus' <i>Dionysiaca</i>, 2.356, when Typhon prepares to battle with Zeus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mel\u00e9e, Nike (\"Victory\") led Zeus to battle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of Polytekhnos and Aedon. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to rack discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos' son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cultural_influences\">Cultural influences</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Discordianism\">Discordianism</span></h3>\n\n<p>Eris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern Discordian religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by Gregory Hill and Kerry Wendell Thornley under the pen names of \"Malaclypse the Younger\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation.</p>\n<p>A quote from the <i>Principia Discordia</i>, the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear up the matter:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>One day Mal-2 consulted his Pineal Gland and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. \"They were,\" She added, \"victims of indigestion, you know.\"</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But she is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the <i>Principia</i>, and is referred to as the Original Snub. The <i>Principia Discordia</i> states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister Aneris (called the equivalent of Harmonia by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.</p>\n<p>Discordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.</p>\n<p>In this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The concept of Eris as developed by the <i>Principia Discordia</i> is used and expanded upon in the science fiction work <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i> by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson (in which characters from <i>Principia Discordia</i> appear). In this work, Eris is a major character.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Other\">Other</span></h3>\n<p>The classic fairy tale <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> is partly inspired by Eris' role in the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Like Eris, a malevolent fairy curses a princess after not being invited to the princess' christening.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>Aneris</li>\n<li>Discordian Works</li>\n<li>Eris (dwarf planet)</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Goddess Eris at Theoi.com, ancient texts and art</li>\n<li>Hesiod\u2019s <i>Works And Days</i></li>\n<li>Hesiod\u2019s <i>Theogony</i></li>\n<li>Homer\u2019s <i>Iliad</i></li>\n<li>Homer's Iliad at Gutenberg (there are many different translations at Gutenberg)</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Birth of Venus detail.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Commons-logo.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Eris Antikensammlung Berlin F1775.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Golden Apple of Discord by Jacob Jordaens.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Greek Roman Laurel wreath vector.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Laurel wreath fa13.gif"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg"}]}

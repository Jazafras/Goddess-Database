{"pageid": 85209, "ns": 0, "title": "Dea Tacita", "extract": "<p>In Roman mythology, <b>Dea Tacita</b> (\"the silent goddess\") was a goddess of the dead. Ovid's <i>Fasti</i> includes a passage describing a rite propitiating Dea Tacita in order to \"seal up hostile mouths / and unfriendly tongue\" at Feralia on 21\u00a0February. In later times, she was equated with the naiad Larunda. In this guise, Dea Tacita was worshipped at a festival called Larentalia on 23\u00a0December. Goddesses <i>Mutae Tacitae</i> were invoked to destroy a hated person: in an inscription from Cambodunum in Raetia, someone asks \"ut mutus sit Quartus\" and \"erret fugiens ut mus\". These silent goddesses are the personification of terror of obscurity. Plutarch, who describes Tacita as a Muse, states that Numa Pompilius credited Tacita for his oracular insight and taught the Romans to worship her.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}]}

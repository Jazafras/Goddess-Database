When the Milesians arrived from Galicia, each of the three sisters asked that their name be given to the country. This was granted to them, although \u00c9riu (\u00c9ire) became the chief name in use. (Banba and F\u00f3dla are still sometimes used as poetic names for Ireland, much as <i>Albion</i> is used as a poetic name for Great Britain.)</p>\n<p>\u00c9riu, Banba and F\u00f3dla are interpreted as goddesses of sovereignty.</p>\n<p>According to the 17th-century Irish historian Geoffrey Keating (<i>Seathr\u00fan C\u00e9itinn</i>), the three sovereignty goddesses associated with \u00c9ire, Banbha and F\u00f3dla were Badb, Macha and The Morr\u00edgan.</p>\n<p>Different texts have attributed different personal relationships to \u00c9riu. Her husband has been named as Mac Gr\u00e9ine (\u2018Son of the Sun\u2019). She has also been portrayed as the lover of Elatha, a prince of the Fomorians, with whom she had a son Bres, and as the mistress of the hero Lugh. Both Elatha and \u00c9riu are described in some sources as the children of Delbaeth, indicating they may be half-siblings. Her foster-father in the Rennes <i>Dindsenchas</i> was Codal the Roundbreasted, whose feeding Eriu caused the land in Ireland to heave toward the sky.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Name_and_etymology\">Name and etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The University of Wales' reconstructed Proto-Celtic lexicon gives *<i>\u03a6\u012bwerjon-</i> (nominative singular <i>\u03a6\u012bwerj\u014d</i>) as the Proto-Celtic etymology of this name. This Celtic form implies Proto-Indo-European <i>*piHwerjon-</i>, likely related to the adjectival stem <i>*piHwer-</i> \"fat\" (cf. Sanskrit <i>p\u012bvan</i>, f. <i>p\u012bvar\u012b</i> and by-form <i>p\u012bvara</i>, \"fat, full, abounding\") hence meaning \"fat land\" or \"land of abundance\", applied at an early date to the island of Ireland. The Proto-Celtic form became <i>*\u012bweri\u016b</i> in Q-Celtic (Proto-Goidelic). From a similar or somewhat later form were also borrowed Greek <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u1f38\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7</span> <i>I[w]ern\u0113</i> and <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1</span> <i>Iouernia</i>; the latter form was converted into Latin <i>Hibernia</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<p>Boydell, Barra. \"The female harp: The Irish harp in 18th- and early\u201319th-century Romantic nationalism\", <i>RIdIM/RCMI newsletter</i> XX/1 (spring 1995), 10\u201317.</p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:'The Harp of Erin', oil on canvas painting by Thomas Buchanan Read.JPG"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}]}

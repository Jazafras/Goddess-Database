Her name comes from the Latin word <i>pomum</i>, \"fruit,\" specifically orchard fruit.</p>\n<p>Pomona was said to be a wood nymph.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mythology\">Mythology</span></h2>\n<p>In the myth narrated by Ovid, she scorned the love of the woodland gods Silvanus and Picus, but married Vertumnus after he tricked her, disguised as an old woman. She and Vertumnus shared a festival held on August 13. Her priest was called the <i>flamen Pomonalis</i>. The pruning knife was her attribute. There is a grove that is sacred to her called the <i>Pomonal</i>, located not far from Ostia, the ancient port of Rome.</p>\n<p>Pomona was the goddess of fruit trees, gardens, and orchards. Unlike many other Roman goddesses and gods, she does not have a Greek counterpart, though she is commonly associated with Demeter. She watches over and protects fruit trees and cares for their cultivation. She was not actually associated with the harvest of fruits itself, but with the flourishing of the fruit trees. In artistic depictions she is generally shown with a platter of fruit or a cornucopia.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Namesakes\">Namesakes</span></h2>\n<p>The City of Pomona in Los Angeles County, California, is named after the goddess.

This location would place the temple on the same side of the Velia as the Forum and perhaps not far from the Regia. Cicero explains her name as deriving from <i>vincendi atque potiundi</i>, \"conquering and gaining mastery.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the <i>Apocolocyntosis</i>, Vica Pota is the mother of Diespiter; although usually identified with Jupiter, Diespiter is here treated as a separate deity, and in the view of Arthur Bernard Cook should perhaps be regarded as the chthonic Dispater. The festival of Vica Pota was January 5.</p>\n<p>Asconius identifies her with Victoria, but she is probably an earlier Roman or Italic form of victory goddess that predated Victoria and the influence of Greek Nike; Vica Pota was thus the older equivalent of Victoria but probably not a personification of victory as such. In a conjecture not widely accepted, Ludwig Preller thought that Vica Pota might be identified with the Etruscan divine figure Lasa Vecu.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Vacuna, sometimes also identified as a goddess of victory</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Capitoline Wolf of Roman Kingdom.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Winged victory0 brescia by stefano Bolognini.JPG"}]}

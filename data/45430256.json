Her parents learn of her desire, discourage her, but she pursues what she wants and did Tap for about 5000 years. In mean time Gods approached god Kamadeva - the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection and asks him to generate desire in Shiva for Parvati. They did this because of an asura named Tarkasur who gained the boon of being killed by only Lord Shiva's child. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire. Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns the cupid Kama to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva. She begins to live in mountains like Shiva, engage in the same activities as Shiva, one of asceticism, yogin and tapas - it is this aspect of Parvati that is deemed to be that of goddess Brahmacharini. Her ascetic pursuit draws the attention of Shiva and awakens his interest. He meets her in disguised form, tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva's weaknesses and personality problems. Parvati refuses to listen and insists in her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Festival\">Festival</span></h2>\n<p>Goddess Brahmacharini is worshipped on the second day of Navratri.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:2-Maa Brahmachaarini (Vaishno Devi Maa Chhatikra-Vrindaban).png"}]}

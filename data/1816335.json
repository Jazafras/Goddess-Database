She is the wife of Perendi, and referred to in Albanian legends as <i>Zonja e Bukuris</i> (\"Lady of Beauty\"), while her sacred day was Friday.</p>\n<p>Prende is analogous to the Roman goddess, Venus, but there may be a potential connection with the Norse goddess, Freyja too, who is also a goddess of love and beauty. In \"A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture\", the author Robert Elsie explains how Prende was worshipped in northern Albania, especially by the Albanian women. Prende\u2019s festival was celebrated on July 26 every year, and her devotees would don beautiful clothing and would set out a mortar and pestle as a representation of sexual union. Elsie also explains how the rainbow is sacred to <i>Veneranda</i>, a Latin term for the goddess Venus, and the rainbow is referenced as \"Lady Prende's Belt\".</p>\n<p>When Albania became Christianized in the early Middle Ages, Prende was identified by the Catholic Church as Saint Anne, mother of Virgin Mary Albanian: <span lang=\"sq\" xml:lang=\"sq\"><i>Sh\u00ebnepremte or Prende</i></span>, known in Gheg dialect as <i>Prenne</i> or <i>Perende</i>. There is one other Albanian Christian saint thought by some to have a non-Christian origin: Gjin.</p>\n<p>As is usual in many cultures, in Albania, Friday is the day sacred to the goddess of love as well. The name is used today in the Albanian language for Friday (E premte).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Albanian mythology</li>\n<li>Perendi</li>\n<li>Venus</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Draig.svg"}]}

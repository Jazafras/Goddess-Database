She was the daughter of Asclepius and Epione, sister of Iaso, Hygieia, Panacea, and Aegle. Her grandfather was Apollo. Unlike her sister Panacea (Cure-All) she represented the process of a curing rather than the cure itself. Her male counterpart was Acesis (Akesis). In Greek sculptural reliefs, Aceso appears alongside her father Asclepius and sisters Hygeia, Panacea and Iaso.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>List of Greek mythological figures</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

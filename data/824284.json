The noun <i>Saul\u0117</i>/<i>Saule</i> in the Lithuanian and Latvian languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Baltic name *<i>Sauli\u0101</i> &gt; *<i>Saul\u0113</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Representation\">Representation</span></h2>\n<p>Saul\u0117 is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of life and fertility, warmth and health. She is patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. The Lithuanian and Latvian words for \"the world\" (<i>pasaulis</i> and <i>pasaule</i>) are translated as \"[a place] under the Sun\".</p>\n<p>Saul\u0117 is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on Lithuanian mythology. According to Slavic translation of the Chronicle by John Malalas (1261), a powerful smith Teliavelis made the Sun and threw it into the sky. Missionary Jeronim Jan Silvanus Prazsky (ca. 1369\u20131440) spent three years attempting to Christianize Lithuania and later recounted a myth about kidnapped Saul\u0117. She was held in a tower by powerful king and rescued by the zodiac using a giant sledgehammer. Jeronim Prazsky swore that he personally witnessed the hammer, venerated by the locals.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Family\">Family</span></h2>\n<p>Saul\u0117 and M\u0117nuo/M\u0113ness (the Moon) were wife and husband. M\u0117nuo fell in love with Au\u0161rin\u0117 (the morning star or Venus). For his infidelity, Perk\u016bnas (thunder god) punished M\u0117nuo. There are different accounts of the punishment. One version has it that M\u0117nuo was cut into two pieces, but he did not learn from his mistakes and thus the punishment is repeated every month. Another version claims that M\u0117nuo and Saul\u0117 divorced, but both wanted to see their daughter \u017demyna (earth). That is why the Sun shines during the day, while the Moon visits at night. A third version claims that the face of M\u0117nuo was disfigured by either Dievas (the supreme god) or Saul\u0117.</p>\n<p>In other myths, Au\u0161rin\u0117 is depicted as a daughter and servant of Saul\u0117. Au\u0161rin\u0117 lights the fire for Saul\u0117 and makes her ready for another day's journey across the sky. Vakarin\u0117 (the evening star) makes the bed for Saul\u0117 in the evening. In the Lithuanian mythology, Saul\u0117 was mother of other planets: Indraja (Jupiter), S\u0117lija (Saturn), \u017diezdr\u0117 (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Feasts\">Feasts</span></h2>\n<p>Saul\u0117's feast was celebrated during the summer solstice. Lithuanian Rasos (turned into Saint Jonas' Festival by Christianity) and Latvian L\u012bgo (turned into J\u0101\u0146i) involve making wreaths, looking for the magical fern flower, burning bonfires, dancing around and leaping over the fire, and greeting the sun when it rises at around 4am next morning. It is the most joyous traditional holiday. The winter solstice is celebrated as the return of Saul\u0117. Christianity absorbed Lithuanian K\u016b\u010dios and Latvian Ziemassv\u0113tki into Christmas. Other celebrations took place around the equinoxes.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Apeigine saule.jpg"}]}

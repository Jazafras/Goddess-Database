For Peitharkhia (Obedience) is the mother of Eupraxia (Success), wife of Soter (Salvation)--as the saying goes. So she is, but the power of god Zeus is supreme, and often in bad times it raises the helpless man out of harsh misery even when stormclouds are lowering over his eyes.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Theoi Project - Peitharchia</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Atene - Partenone.jpg"}]}

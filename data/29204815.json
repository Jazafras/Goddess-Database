{"pageid": 29204815, "ns": 0, "title": "Molae", "extract": "<p>The <b>Moles</b> are goddesses who appear in an ancient Roman prayer formula in connection with Mars. The list of invocations given by Aulus Gellius pairs a god's name (given in the genitive case) with a feminine nominative noun that personifies a quality or power of the god <i>(Moles Martis,</i> \"Moles of Mars\"). These pairings are often taken as \"marriages\" in the anthropomorphic mythological tradition. An inscription records a <i>supplicatio Molibus Martis</i>, supplication for the Moles of Mars.</p>\n<p>The name <i>Mola</i> (plural <i>Molae</i>) would refer to a goddess of the mill, as in <i>mola salsa</i>, the ritual substance prepared by the Vestals from flour and salt, but the connection with war or Mars would be unclear, though perhaps conceptually related to <i>Iuppiter Pistor,</i> \"Jupiter the Miller\". W.H. Roscher includes <i>Mola</i> among the <i>indigitamenta</i>, the list of deities maintained by Roman priests to assure that the correct divinity was invoked for rituals.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

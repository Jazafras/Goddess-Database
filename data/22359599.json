She is worshipped in the Vietnamese folk religion and \u0110\u1ea1o M\u1eabu, the mother goddess religion. She is also known as Lady Po Nagar, the Cham deity from whom she originated. The Cham people of Vietnam had been much influenced by India, and it is believed that P\u00f4 Nagar is represented with the characteristics of Bhagavati Uma. The cult of Thi\u00ean Y A Na is popular in Vietnam, particularly among women. She is channeled through L\u00ean \u0111\u1ed3ng rituals. There have been many temples and shrines devoted to her throughout the last several centuries.</p>\n<p>It is widely believed that the deity known as Thi\u00ean Y A Na is the Vietnamized version of the Cham deity, P\u00f4 Nagar, meaning \u201cLady of the Kingdom\u201d. When the Vi\u1ec7t came down from the North to central Vietnam and took over control of the land occupied by the Cham people, they attempted to assimilate the Cham into Vi\u1ec7t culture. In doing so, they Vietnamized certain aspects of Cham culture that appealed to the Vi\u1ec7t. It is through this process that the goddess P\u00f4 Nagar became Thi\u00ean Y A Na.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Legend_of_P\u00f4_Nagar\"></span><span id=\"The_Legend_of_P.C3.B4_Nagar\">The Legend of P\u00f4 Nagar</span></h2>\n<p>According to the myth of P\u00f4 Nagar, she was born from the clouds of the sky and the foam of the sea. Her physical form was manifest in a piece of eaglewood floating on the waves of the ocean. She is also said to have had ninety-seven husbands and thirty-nine daughters who became goddesses like their mother. P\u00f4 Nagar was the goddess who created the earth, eaglewood and rice. It is told that there was even the aroma of rice in the air around her. The Chams looked upon her as a goddess of plants and trees. She was considered nurturing like the earth and she granted blessings to her followers.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Vietnamization_of_P\u00f4_Nagar\"></span><span id=\"Vietnamization_of_P.C3.B4_Nagar\">Vietnamization of P\u00f4 Nagar</span></h2>\n<p>After the Vietnamese adopted the P\u00f4 Nagar deity, they made several changes. They changed her name to \"Thien Y A Na Di\u1ec5n Phi Ch\u00faa Ng\u1ecdc Th\u00e0nh Phi\". Since the Vi\u1ec7t were Confucian, they altered several aspects of P\u00f4 Nagar when incorporating her into their culture. There was no longer any mention of her having multiple husbands, nor did she have a large number of children. Instead, she was described as an immortal being, who could transform herself into a trunk of eaglewood at will. She used this ability to escape to China, where she married a prince. Later, she is said to have returned to Vietnam to teach her people. She was a powerful goddess who demanded respect and used her supernatural powers to punish those who disrespected her. She has also become a Buddhist deity, rather than an indigenous figure.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Thi\u00ean_Y_A_Na_Cult\"></span><span id=\"Thi.C3.AAn_Y_A_Na_Cult\">Thi\u00ean Y A Na Cult</span></h2>\n<p>Today she is the object of worship for many.

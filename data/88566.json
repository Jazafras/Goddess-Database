She is the mother of the thunder god Thor, son of Odin, and the personification of the Earth. Fj\u00f6rgyn and <b>Hl\u00f3\u00f0yn</b> are considered to be other names for J\u00f6r\u00f0. Some scholars refer to J\u00f6r\u00f0 as a goddess. J\u00f6r\u00f0's name appears in skaldic poetry both as a poetic term for the land and in kennings for Thor.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p><i>J\u00f6r\u00f0</i> is the common word for <i>earth</i> in Old Norse, as are the word's descendants in the modern Scandinavian languages; Icelandic <i>j\u00f6r\u00f0</i>, Faroese <i>j\u00f8r\u00f0</i>, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian <i>jord</i>. It is cognate to English \"earth\" through Old English <i>eor\u00f0e</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Gylfaginning\"><i>Gylfaginning</i></span></h3>\n<p>In <i>Gylfaginning</i>, the first part of the Prose Edda, J\u00f6r\u00f0 is described as one of Odin's sexual partners and the mother of Thor. She is the daughter of Annar and N\u00f3tt and half-sister of Au\u00f0r and Dagr.</p>\n<p>However, scholar Haukur Thorgeirsson points out that the four manuscripts of <i>Gylfaginning</i> vary in their descriptions of the family relations between N\u00f3tt, J\u00f6r\u00f0, Dagr, and Dellingr. In other words, depending on the manuscript, either J\u00f6r\u00f0 or N\u00f3tt is the mother of Dagr and partner of Dellingr. Haukur details that \"the oldest manuscript, U, offers a version where J\u01ebr\u00f0 is the wife of Dellingr and the mother of Dagr while the other manuscripts, R, W and T, cast N\u00f3tt in the role of Dellingr's wife and Dagr's mother\", and argues that \"the version in U came about accidentally when the writer of U or its antecedent shortened a text similar to that in RWT. The results of this accident made their way into the Icelandic poetic tradition\".</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\"></span><span id=\"Sk.C3.A1ldskaparm.C3.A1l\"><i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i></span></h3>\n<p>In Snorri Sturluson's <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, J\u00f6r\u00f0 (as the personified earth) is called the rival of Odin's wife Frigg and his other giantess concubines, Rindr and Gunnl\u00f6d, the mother-in-law of Sif, Thor's wife, daughter of N\u00f3tt, and sister of Au\u00f0r and Dagr.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Poetic_Edda\">Poetic Edda</span></h3>\n<p>In <i>Lokasenna</i>, Thor is called <i>Jar\u00f0ar burr</i> (\"son of J\u00f6r\u00f0\").</p>\n<p>In the same verse in <i>V\u00f6lusp\u00e1</i>, he is referred to as <i>m\u01ebgr Hl\u00f3\u00f0yniar</i> and <i>Fj\u01ebrgyniar burr</i> (child of Hl\u00f3\u00f0yn, Fj\u00f6rgyn's child). The otherwise unknown Hl\u00f3\u00f0yn was therefore another name of J\u00f6r\u00f0. She is usually thought to be identical with Hludana, to whom Roman votive tablets have been found on the Lower Rhine.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Crystal Clear app kedit.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Moder Jord.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:The Wolves Pursuing Sol and Mani.jpg"}]}

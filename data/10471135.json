Her favorite places to linger are graveyards and cemeteries; in fact, one Finnish word for graveyard is <i>kalmisto</i>, derived from her name. Some sources state that she moves on a vehicle of odors, much like a puff of smoke.</p>\n<p>Her father is Tuoni and her mother Tuonetar. Kalma may also have several sisters, Kipu-Tytt\u00f6, Kivutar, Loviatar, and Vammatar, all of whom live in the Finnish underworld realm of Tuonela. Kalma is accompanied and protected by Surma, a dog-like creature whose name literally means <i>death\" (though the word \"surma\" is usually used to refer to someone being killed, as opposed to dying of natural causes)'.</i></p>\n<p>Their stories are recited in the Finnish national epic Kalevala.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:H\u00e9raldique meuble Soleil avec visage.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Venesarvinen hirvi.jpg"}]}

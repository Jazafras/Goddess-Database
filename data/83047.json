She died a virgin and was worshipped as a heroine on the island of Rhodes.</p>\n<p>It is speculated by some that she was possibly a goddess of the morning, or of man's waking sense, which causes him to wake up in the morning; the Doric form of her name is akin to the Greek word for \"rooster\" (Alectrona, the feminine genitive of \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1, <b>Alektor</b>, the ancient Greek word for \"rooster\"), while the Attic form Electryone is akin to the word for \"amber\" (\u1f28\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, <b>Elektra</b>), as in the amber color of sunrise (as opposed to sunset, implied by Helios being her father); naturally, either of which would be an appropriate name for a solar goddess.</p>\n<p>A marble tablet from the 3rd century BC found in Ialyssus contains an inscription about the regulations for visitors to the temple of Alectrona.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Graves, Robert; <i>The Greek Myths</i>, Penguin Books Ltd.

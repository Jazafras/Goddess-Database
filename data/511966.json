The word <i>Potnia</i>, meaning mistress or lady, was a Mycenaean Greek word inherited by Classical Greek, with the same meaning, cognate to Sanskrit <i><span title=\"International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\">patn\u012b</span>.</i></p>\n<p>Homer's mention of <i>potnia theron</i> is thought to refer to Artemis and Walter Burkert describes this mention as \"a well established formula\". An Artemis type deity, a 'Mistress of the Animals', is often assumed to have existed in prehistorical religion and often referred to as Potnia Theron, with some scholars positing a relationship between Artemis and goddesses depicted in Minoan art and \"<i>Potnia Theron</i> has become a generic term for any female associated with animals.\"</p>\n<p>Many depictions use a female version of the widespread ancient motif of the male Master of Animals, showing a central figure with a human form grasping two animals, one to each side. The oldest depiction has been discovered in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck. Another example of <i>Potnia ther\u00f2n</i> is situated in Museo civico archeologico di Monte Rinaldo  in Italy: plate illustrates goddess that wears a long dress and holds hands with two panthers.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Inara (goddess)</li>\n<li>Mother Goddess</li>\n<li>Feronia (mythology)</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ankara Muzeum B19-36.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Commons-logo.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:NAMA Art\u00e9mis Orthia.jpg"}]}

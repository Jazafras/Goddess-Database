She is the female principle, sister and wife of Anshar, the male principle, and the mother of Anu. Kishar may represent the earth as a counterpart to Anshar, the sky, and can be seen as an earth mother goddess. Her name also means \"Whole Earth\".</p>\n<p>Kishar appears only once in Enuma Elish, in the opening lines of the epic, and then disappears from the remainder of the story. She appears only occasionally in other first millennium BCE texts, where she can be equated with the goddess Antu.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses: An\u0161ar and Ki\u0161ar (god and goddess)</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ambox important.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Chaos Monster and Sun God.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Palm tree symbol.svg"}]}

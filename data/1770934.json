The name may be transliterated in different versions - <i>Khepat</i> with the feminine ending <i>-t</i> is primarily the Syrian and Ugaritic version.</p>\n<p>In the Hurrian language <i>\u1e2aepa</i> is the most likely pronunciation of the name of the goddess. In modern literature the sound /h/ in cuneiform sometimes is transliterated as <i>kh</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Arinniti\">Arinniti</span></h2>\n<p>The Hittite sun goddess Arinniti was later assimilated with Hebat. A prayer of Queen Puduhepa makes this explicit: \"To the Sun-goddess of Arinna, my lady, the mistress of the Hatti lands, the queen of Heaven and Earth. Sun-goddess of Arinna, thou art Queen of all countries! In the Hatti country thou bearest the name of the Sun-goddess of Arinna; but in the land which thou madest the cedar land thou bearest the name Hebat.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Widespread_veneration\">Widespread veneration</span></h2>\n<p>\u1e2aepat was venerated all over the ancient Near East.

{"pageid": 1743598, "ns": 0, "title": "Sophia (wisdom)", "extract": "<p><b>Sophia</b> (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, Greek for \"wisdom\") is a central idea in Hellenistic philosophy and religion, Platonism, Gnosticism, orthodox Christianity, Esoteric Christianity, and Christian mysticism. Sophiology is a philosophical concept regarding wisdom, as well as a theological concept regarding the wisdom of the biblical God.</p>\n<p>Sophia is a goddess of wisdom by Gnostics, as well as by some Neopagan, New Age, and Goddess spirituality groups. In Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christianity, Sophia, or rather Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), is an expression of understanding for the second person of the Holy Trinity (as in the dedication of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople), as well as in the Old Testament, as seen in the Book of Proverbs 9:1, but not an angel or goddess.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Platonism\">Platonism</span></h2>\n\n<p>Plato, following his teacher, Socrates (and, it is likely, the older tradition of Pythagoras), understands philosophy as \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (<i>philo-sophia</i>, or, literally, a friend of Wisdom). This understanding of <i>philosophia</i> permeates Plato's dialogues, especially the <i>Republic</i>. In that work, the leaders of the proposed utopia are to be philosopher kings: rulers who are friends of sophia or Wisdom.</p>\n<p><i>Sophia</i> is one of the four cardinal virtues in Plato's <i>Protagoras</i>.</p>\n<p>The Pythian Oracle (Oracle of Delphi) reportedly answered the question of \"who is the wisest man of Greece?\" with \"Socrates!\" Socrates defends this verdict in his <i>Apology</i> to the effect that he, at least, knows that he knows nothing. As is evident in Plato's portrayals of Socrates, this does not mean Socrates' wisdom was the same as knowing nothing; but rather that his skepticism towards his own self-made constructions of knowledge left him free to receive true Wisdom as a spontaneous insight or inspiration. This contrasted with the attitude of contemporaneous Greek Sophists, who claimed to be wise and offered to teach wisdom for pay.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Old_Testament_and_Jewish_texts\">Old Testament and Jewish texts</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Septuagint\">Septuagint</span></h3>\n\n<p>The Greek noun <i>sophia</i> is the translation of \"wisdom\" in the Greek Septuagint for Hebrew <span lang=\"he\" xml:lang=\"he\">\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea</span> <i><span lang=\"he-Latn\" xml:lang=\"he-Latn\">\u1e24okmot</span></i>. Wisdom is a central topic in the \"sapiential\" books, i.e. Proverbs, Psalms, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Book of Wisdom, Wisdom of Sirach, and to some extent Baruch (the last three are Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament.)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Philo_and_the_Logos\">Philo and the Logos</span></h3>\n\n<p>Philo, a Hellenised Jew writing in Alexandria, attempted to harmonise Platonic philosophy and Jewish scripture. Also influenced by Stoic philosophical concepts, he used the Greek term <i>logos</i>, \"word,\" for the role and function of Wisdom, a concept later adapted by the author of the Gospel of John in the opening verses and applied to Jesus Christ as the eternal Word (Logos) of God the Father.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Christianity\">Christianity</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>In Christian theology, \"wisdom\" (Hebrew: <i>Chokhmah</i>, Greek: <i>Sophia</i>, Latin: <i>Sapientia</i>) describes an aspect of God, or the theological concept regarding the wisdom of God.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"New_Testament\">New Testament</span></h3>\n<p>Jesus directly mentions Wisdom in the Gospel of Matthew:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her deeds.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>His wisdom is recognized by the people of Nazareth, his hometown, during his 'return' visit, there which in Matthew's gospel separates his major Galilean ministry and his final Galilean ministry</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>They were astonished and said, \u201cWhere did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works?\"</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>St. Paul refers to the concept, notably in 1 Corinthians, but obscurely, deconstructing worldly wisdom:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paul sets worldly wisdom against a higher wisdom of God:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Epistle of James (James 3:13-18; cf. James 1:5) distinguishes between two kinds of wisdom. One is a false wisdom, which is characterized as \"earthly, sensual, devilish\" and is associated with strife and contention. The other is the 'wisdom that comes from above':</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span id=\"Eastern_Orthodoxy\">Eastern Orthodoxy</span></h3>\n<p>In the mystical theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Holy Wisdom is understood as the Divine Logos who became incarnate as Jesus Christ; this belief being sometimes also expressed in some Eastern Orthodox icons. In Eastern Orthodoxy humility is the highest wisdom and is to be sought more than any other virtue. Not only does humility cultivate the Holy Wisdom, but it (in contrast to knowledge) is the defining quality that grants people salvation and entrance into Heaven. The Hagia Sophia or Holy Wisdom church in Constantinople was the religious center of the Eastern Orthodox Church for nearly a thousand years.</p>\n\n<p>In the Divine Liturgy of the Orthodox Church, the exclamation <i>Sophia!</i> or in English <i>Wisdom!</i> will be proclaimed by the deacon or priest at certain moments, especially before the reading of scripture, to draw the congregation's attention to sacred teaching.</p>\n<p>The concept of Sophia has been championed as a key part of the Godhead by some Eastern Orthodox religious thinkers. These included Vladimir Solovyov, Pavel Florensky, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Sergei Bulgakov whose book <i>Sophia: The Wisdom of God</i> is in many ways the apotheosis of Sophiology. For Bulgakov, the Sophia is co-existent with the Trinity, operating as the feminine aspect of God in concert with the three masculine principles of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Vladimir Lossky rejects Solovyev and Bulgakov's teachings as error. Lossky states that Wisdom as an energy of God (just as love, faith and grace are also energies of God) is not to be ascribed to be the true essence of God, as to do so is to deny the apophatic and incomprehensible nature of the Divine essence. Bulgakov's work was denounced by the Russian Orthodox as heretical.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Roman_Catholic_mysticism\">Roman Catholic mysticism</span></h3>\n\n<p>In Roman Catholic mysticism, the Doctor of the Church St. Hildegard of Bingen celebrated Sophia as a cosmic figure in both her writing and her art. Sophia, in Catholic theology, is the Wisdom of God, and is thus eternal.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Protestant_mysticism\">Protestant mysticism</span></h3>\n\n<p>Within the Protestant tradition in England, Jane Leade, 17th-century Christian mystic, Universalist, and founder of the Philadelphian Society, wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the \"Virgin Sophia\" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the Universe.</p>\n<p>Leade was hugely influenced by the theosophical writings of 16th century German Christian mystic Jakob B\u00f6hme, who also speaks of the Sophia in works such as <i>The Way to Christ</i>. Jakob B\u00f6hme was very influential to a number of Christian mystics and religious leaders, including George Rapp and the Harmony Society.</p>\n<p>Sophia can be described as the wisdom of God, and, at times, as a pure virgin spirit which emanates from God. The Sophia is seen as being expressed in all creation and the natural world as well as, for some of the Christian mystics mentioned above, integral to the spiritual well-being of humankind, the church, and the cosmos. The Virgin is seen as outside creation but compassionately interceding on behalf of humanity to alleviate its suffering by illuminating true spiritual seekers with wisdom and the love of God.</p>\n<p>The main difference between the concept of Sophia found in most traditional forms of Christian mysticism and the one more aligned with the Gnostic view of Sophia is that to many Christian mystics she is not seen as fallen or in need of redemption. Conversely, she is not as central in most forms of established Christianity as she is in Gnosticism, but to some Christian mystics the Sophia is a very important concept.</p>\n<p>In the Heavenly Faith school of thought, the Holy Spirit is synonymous with Sophia, being the feminine counterpart to the masculine Logos. Whereas the latter is incarnated in Jesus of Nazareth, the former is effectively incarnate in the Church in so far as She is the spirit which circulates through and binds together all Christians.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"In_Christology\">In Christology</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The Old Testament theme of wisdom also proved its worth for the first Christians when reflecting on their experience of Jesus. The conceptuality offered various possibilities.</p>\n<p>Proverbs vividly personifies the divine attribute or function of wisdom, which existed before the world was made, revealed God, and acted as God's agent in creation (Prov 8:22\u201331 cf. 3:19; Wisdom 8:4-6; Sir 1:4,9). Wisdom dwelt with God (Prov 8:22\u201331; cf. Sir 24:4; Wisdom 9:9-10) and being the exclusive property of God was as such inaccessible to human beings (Job 28:12\u201313, 20\u20131, 23\u201327). It was God who \"found\" wisdom (Bar 3:29-37) and gave her to Israel: \"He found the whole way to knowledge, and gave her to Jacob his servant and to Israel whom he loved. Afterward she appeared upon earth and lived among human beings\" (Bar 3:36-37; Sir 24:1-12). As a female figure (Sir. 1:15; Wis. 7:12), wisdom addressed human beings (Prov. 1:20\u201333; 8:1\u20139:6) inviting to her feast those who are not yet wise (Prov. 9:1-6). The finest passage celebrating the divine wisdom (Wis. 7:22b-8:1) includes the following description: \"She is a breath of the power of God, and the radiance of the glory of the Almighty... She is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness\" (Wisdom 7:25-26). No wonder then that Solomon, the archetypal wise person, fell in love with wisdom: \"I loved her and sought her from my youth; I desired to take her for my bride, and became enamored of her beauty\" (Wisdom 8:2). Such was the radiant beauty of the wisdom exercised by God both in creation and in relations with the chosen people.</p>\n<p>In understanding and interpreting Christ, the New Testament uses various strands from these accounts of wisdom. First, like wisdom, Christ pre-existed all things and dwelt with God John 1:1\u20132); second, the lyric language about wisdom being the breath of the divine power, reflecting divine glory, mirroring light, and being an image of God, appears to be echoed by 1 Corinthians 1:17\u201318, 24\u20135 (verses which associate divine wisdom with power), by Hebrews 1:3 (\"he is the radiance of God's glory\"), John 1:9 (\"the true light that gives light to everyone\"), and Colossians 1:15 (\"the image of the invisible God\"). Third, the New Testament applies to Christ the language about wisdom's cosmic significance as God's agent in the creation of the world: \"all things were made through him, and without him nothing was made that was made\" (John 1:3; see Col 1:16 Heb 1:2). Fourth, faced with Christ's crucifixion, Paul vividly transforms the notion of divine wisdom's inaccessibility (1 Cor. 1:17-2:13). \"The wisdom of God\" (1 Cor. 1:21) is not only \"secret and hidden\" (1 Cor. 2:7) but also, defined by the cross and its proclamation, downright folly to the wise of this world (1 Cor. 1:18-25; see also Matt 11:25-7). Fifth, through his parables and other ways, Christ teaches wisdom (Matt 25:1-12 Luke 16:1-18, cf. also Matt 11:25\u201330). He is 'greater' than Solomon, the Old Testament wise person and teacher <i>par excellence</i> (Matt 12:42). Sixth, the New Testament does not, however, seem to have applied to Christ the themes of Lady Wisdom and her radiant beauty. Pope Leo the Great (d. 461), however, recalled Proverbs 9:1 by picturing the unborn Jesus in Mary's womb as \"Wisdom building a house for herself\" (<i>Epistolae</i>, 31. 2-3). Strands from the Old testament ideas about wisdom are more or less clearly taken up (and changed) in New Testament interpretations of Christ. Here and there the New Testament eventually not only ascribes wisdom roles to Christ, but also makes the equation \"divine wisdom=Christ\" quite explicit. Luke reports how the boy Jesus grew up \"filled with wisdom\" (Luke 2:40; see Luke 2:52). Later, Christ's fellow-countrymen were astonished \"at the wisdom given to him\" (Mark 6:2). Matthew 11:19 thinks of him as divine wisdom being \"proved right by his deeds\" (see, however, the different and probably original version of Luke 7:35). Possibly Luke 11:49 wishes to present Christ as \"the wisdom of God\". Paul names Christ as \"the wisdom of God\" (1 Cor. 1:24) whom God \"made our wisdom\" (1 Cor. 1:30; cf. 1:21). A later letter softens the claim a little: in Christ \"all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden\" (Col 2:3). Beyond question, the clearest form of the equation \"the divine wisdom=Christ\" comes in 1 Corinthians 1:17-2:13. Yet, even there Paul's impulse is to explain \"God's hidden wisdom\" not so much as the person of Christ himself, but rather as God's \"wise and hidden purpose from the very beginning to bring us to our destined glory\" (1 Cor. 2:7). In other words, when Paul calls Christ \"the wisdom of God\", even more than in the case of other titles, God's eternal plan of salvation overshadows everything.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"In_Patristics\">In Patristics</span></h4>\n\n<p>At times the Church Fathers named Christ as \"Wisdom\". Therefore, when rebutting claims about Christ's ignorance, Gregory of Nazianzus insisted that, inasmuch as he was divine, Christ knew everything: \"How can he be ignorant of anything that is, when he is Wisdom, the maker of the worlds, who brings all things to fulfilment and recreates all things, who is the end of all that has come into being?\" (<i>Orationes</i>, 30.15). Irenaeus represents another, minor patristic tradition which identified the Spirit of God, and not Christ himself, as \"Wisdom\" (<i>Adversus haereses</i>, 4.20.1\u20133; cf. 3.24.2; 4.7.3; 4.20.3). He could appeal to Paul's teaching about wisdom being one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:8). However, the majority applied to Christ the title/name of \"Wisdom\". Eventually the Emperor Constantine set a pattern for Eastern Christians by dedicating a church to Christ as the personification of divine wisdom. In Constantinople, under Emperor Justinian, Santa Sophia (\"Holy Wisdom\") was rebuilt, consecrated in 538, and became a model for many other Byzantine churches. Nevertheless, in the New testament and subsequent Christian thought (at least Western thought) \"the Word\" or <i>Logos</i> came through more clearly than \"the Wisdom\" of God as a central, high title of Christ. The portrayal of the Word in the prologue of John's Gospel shows a marked resemblance to what is said about wisdom in Proverbs 8:22-31 and Sirach 24:1-2. Yet, that Prologue speaks of the Word, not the Wisdom, becoming flesh and does not follow Baruch in saying that \"Wisdom appeared upon earth and lived among human beings\" (Bar 3:37. When focusing in a classic passage on what \"God has revealed to us through the Spirit\" (1 Cor. 2:10), Paul had written of the hidden and revealed wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:17\u20132:13). Despite the availability of this wisdom language and conceptuality, John prefers to speak of \"the Word\" (John 1:1, 14; cf. 1 John 1:1; Rev 19:13), a term that offers a rich array of meanings.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gnosticism\">Gnosticism</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Contemporary_pagan_Goddess_worship\">Contemporary pagan Goddess worship</span></h2>\n<p>Sophia is worshiped as a goddess of wisdom by gnostics and pagans today, including Wiccan spirituality.

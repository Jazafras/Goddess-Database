Most Colonial-era manuscripts equate her with \u014cmecihu\u0101tl. T\u014dnac\u0101cihu\u0101tl was the consort of Tonacatecuhtli. She is also referred to as Ilhuicacihu\u0101tl or \"Heavenly Lady.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The god's name is a compound of two Nahuatl words: \"t\u014dnac\u0101\" and \"cihu\u0101tl.\" While \"cihu\u0101tl\" can be translated \"woman\" or \"lady,\" \"t\u014dnac\u0101\" presents several possible interpretations. Some read this root as \"tonac\u0101\" (without the long 'o'), consisting of \"nacatl,\" meaning \"human flesh\" or \"food,\" with the possessive prefix \"to\" (\"our\"). By this etymology, T\u014dnac\u0101cihu\u0101tl would mean \"Lady of Our Food\" or \"Lady of Our Flesh,\" most commonly rendered \"Lady of Our Sustenance.\" It should be noted, however that the word \"t\u014dnac\" simply means \"abundance,\" giving T\u014dnac\u0101cihu\u0101tl the alternate reading \"Lady of Abundance.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Origin_and_role\">Origin and role</span></h2>\n<p>T\u014dnac\u0101cihu\u0101tl was the Central Mexican form of the creator goddess common to Mesoamerican religions. According to the <i>Codex R\u00edos</i>, the <i>History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings</i>, the <i>Histoyre du Mechique</i>, and the <i>Florentine Codex</i>, T\u014dnac\u0101cihu\u0101tl and her counterpart T\u014dnac\u0101t\u0113cuhtli resided in Omeyocan, the 13th, highest heaven, from which human souls descended to earth. T\u014dnac\u0101t\u0113cuhtli is associated with procreation, appearing in pre-Columbian art near copulating humans. In the <i>Florentine Codex</i>, Sahag\u00fan relates that Aztec midwives would tell newborns after bathing them, \"You were created in the place of duality, the place above the nine heavens. Your mother and father\u2014\u014cmet\u0113uctli and \u014cmecihu\u0101tl, the heavenly lady\u2014formed you, created you.\"</p>\n<p>In 1629, Hernando Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n also reported the use of the goddess's name in ritual planting prayers, in which a seed of corn is entrusted to the earth deity Tlaltecuhtli by a shaman who calls the kernel \"nohueltiuh T\u014dnac\u0101cihu\u0101tl\" (\"my sister, the Lady of Abundance\").</p>\n<p>In the <i>Codex Chimalpopoca</i>, T\u014dnac\u0101t\u0113cuhtli and T\u014dnac\u0101cihu\u0101tl are listed as one of several pairs of gods to whom Quetzalcoatl prays.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Orange-sun-small.jpg"}]}

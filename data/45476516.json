Goddess Shivaduti made her appearance in the battle against demons Shumbha and Nishumbha. She symbolically represents the unfathomable power of Mother Goddess Shakti. As per Devi Mahatmyam, in the battle against the forces of Shumbh and Nishumbh, Mother Goddess took the manifestation of the Saptamatrikas. They were Shaktis of the male gods. After this appeared Shivaduti, the Shakti of Mother Goddess. This form is not associated with any male form. Devi Mahatmyam states that she appeared from the body of Mother Goddess in the most gruesome form \u2013 yelping like a hundred jackals. She then asked Lord Shiva to carry the message to Shumbha and Nishumbha that if they desire to battle against her out of arrogance and false belief in their strength, then they and their forces be ready to be devoured by her jackals. It must be noted here that Goddess Shivaduti is a symbolic representation of what form Goddess Shakti can take to put down Adharma. She is depicted as a woman armed with a trident and rosary, the right lower hand is in the gesture of fear-dispellings and she seated on a lion.</p>\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ambox important.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aum red.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Wiki letter w.svg"}]}

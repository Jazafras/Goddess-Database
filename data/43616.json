She was Queen of Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedonia by marriage to King Lysimachus (Greek: \u039b\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2), and queen and co-ruler of Egypt with her brother-husband Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Greek: \u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, \"Ptolemy the sibling-loving\").</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Life\">Life</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Early_life\">Early life</span></h3>\n<p>Arsino\u00eb was the first daughter of Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter (Greek: \u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, \"Ptolemy the Savior\"), founder of the Hellenistic state of Egypt, and his second wife Berenice I of Egypt.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Queen_of_Lysimachus\">Queen of Lysimachus</span></h3>\n<p>At about age 15, Arsino\u00eb married King Lysimachus (who was then around 60 years old), to whom she bore three sons: Ptolemy I Epigonos, Lysimachus and Philip. In order to position her sons for the throne, she had Lysimachus' first son, Agathocles, poisoned on account of treason.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Queen_of_Ptolemy_Keraunos\">Queen of Ptolemy Keraunos</span></h3>\n<p>After Lysimachus' death in battle in 281 BC, she fled to Cassandreia (Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) and married her paternal half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos, one of the sons of Ptolemy I from his previous wife, Eurydice of Egypt. The marriage was for political reasons as they both claimed the throne of Macedonia and Thrace (by the time of his death Lysimachus was ruler of both regions, and his power extended to Southern Greece and Asia Minor). Their relationship was never good.</p>\n<p>As Ptolemy Keraunos was becoming more powerful, she decided it was time to stop him and conspired against him with her sons. This action caused Ptolemy Keraunus to kill two of her sons, Lysimachus and Philip, while the eldest, Ptolemy, was able to escape and to flee north, to the kingdom of the Dardanians. She herself went to Alexandria, Egypt to seek protection from her brother, Ptolemy II Philadelphus.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Queen_of_Egypt\">Queen of Egypt</span></h3>\n<p>In Egypt, she is believed to have instigated the accusation and exile of her brother Ptolemy II's first wife, Arsino\u00eb I. Arsino\u00eb II then married her brother. As a result, both were given the epithet \"Philadelphoi\" (Greek: \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9, \"Sibling-loving (plural)\") by the presumably scandalized Greeks.</p>\n<p>Sharing in all of her brother's titles, she apparently was quite influential, having towns dedicated to her, her own cult (as was Egyptian custom), appearing on coinage and contributing to foreign policy, including Ptolemy II's victory in the First Syrian War between Egypt and the Seleucid Empire.</p>\n<p>According to Posidippus, she won three chariot races at the Olympic Games, probably in 272 BC.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Legacy\">Legacy</span></h3>\n<p>After her death, Ptolemy II continued to refer to her on official documents, as well as supporting her coinage and cult. In establishing her worship as a goddess he justified his own cult.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Arsinoitherium</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li>H.

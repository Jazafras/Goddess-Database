However, Theresia Pantzer, reviewing the stone, suggests that what Wright had perceived as traces of a letter <i>g</i> was merely \"damage to the stone rather than part of a letter\". The goddess is otherwise unknown.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Rouelle d or Balesme Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Triskele-Symbol-spiral.svg"}]}

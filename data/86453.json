{"pageid": 86453, "ns": 0, "title": "Dea Matrona", "extract": "<p>In Celtic mythology, <b>Dea Matrona</b> (\"divine mother goddess\") was the goddess who gives her name to the river Marne (ancient <i>Matr\u014fna</i>) in Gaul.</p>\n<p>The Gaulish theonym <i>M\u0101tr-on-\u0101</i> signifies \"great mother\", and the goddess of the Marne has been interpreted to be a mother goddess. Many Gaulish religious images\u2014including inexpensive terracotta statues mass-produced for use in household shrines\u2014depict mother goddesses nursing babies or holding fruits, other foods, or small dogs in their laps. In many areas, such <i>Matronae</i> were depicted in groups of three (or sometimes two) (see Matres and Matronae for the triads of mother-goddesses well attested throughout northern Europe).</p>\n<p>The name of Welsh mythological figure Modron, mother of Mabon is derived from the same etymon. By analogy, Dea Matrona may conceivably have been considered the mother of the Gaulish Maponos.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Aveta, another Gallic mother-goddess</li>\n<li>Matres and Matronae</li>\n<li>Modron</li>\n<li>Triple deities</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Matrona Gaul goddess.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Matrona Gaul goddess alt.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Rouelle d or Balesme Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Triskele-Symbol-spiral.svg"}]}

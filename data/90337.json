Other indigenous (Nahuatl) names include <i>Chic\u014dmex\u014dchitl</i> [<span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">t\u0283ik\u02cco\u02d0me\u02c8\u0283\u00f3\u02d0t\u0283it\u026c</span>] (literally \"Seven Flower\") and <i>Ch\u0101lchiuhcihu\u0101tl</i> [<span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">\u02cct\u0283a\u02d0\u026ct\u0283i\u028d\u02c8s\u00edwa\u02d0t\u026c</span>] (literally \"Emerald/Jade Woman\")[citation needed]. A \"Ton\u0101ntzin\" was honored during the movable feast of <i>X\u014dchilhuitl</i> [<span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">\u0283o\u02d0\u02c8t\u0283\u00ed\u026cwit\u026c</span>]. Some have claimed that upon the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the hill of Tepeyac where Tonantzin's temple had been destroyed by the Spanish priests, the natives recognized Our Lady of Guadalupe as Tonantzin Coatlaxopeuh (Meaning \"Our Lady\" who emerges from the region of light like the Eagle from fire).[citation needed].</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Alleged_syncretism\">Alleged syncretism</span></h2>\n<p>Mexico City's 17th-century Basilica of Guadalupe\u2014built in honor of the Blessed Virgin and perhaps Mexico's most important religious building\u2014was constructed at the base of the hill of Tepeyac, believed to be a site used for pre-Columbian worship of Tonantzin. It has been asserted that the word <i>Guadalupe</i> in this appellation may derive from Coatlaxopeuh, meaning \u201cthe one who crushes the serpent\u201d [citationneeded], and perhaps referring to Quetzalcoatl.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modern_usage\">Modern usage</span></h2>\n<p>Tonantzin is sometimes used as a female given name; Native Californian actress Tonantzin Carmelo is an example. Tona, Tonzi, Toni, and Nantzin are possible nicknames.</p>\n<p>In the comic series Love and Rockets by Gilbert Hernandez and Jaime Hernandez, Tonantzin is the name of a central character in Gilbert's world of Palomar. The character is often linked to the Aztec Goddess.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>Gonz\u00e1lez, Ondina E. and Justo L.

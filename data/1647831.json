{"pageid": 1647831, "ns": 0, "title": "Rheda (mythology)", "extract": "<p>In Anglo-Saxon paganism, <b>Rheda</b> (Latinized from Old English <i>*Hr\u00ea\u00f0e</i> or <i>*Hr\u00ea\u00f0a</i>, possibly meaning \"the famous\" or \"the victorious\") is a goddess connected with the month '\"Rhedmonth\"' (from Old English <i>*Hr\u0113\u00fem\u014dna\u00fe</i>). Rheda is attested solely by Bede in his 8th century work <i>De temporum ratione</i>. While the name of the goddess appears in Bede's Latin manuscript as <i>Rheda</i>, it is reconstructed into Old English as <i>*Hr\u0113\u00fee</i> and is sometimes modernly anglicized as <b>Hretha</b> (also \"Hrethe\" or \"Hrede\"). <i>Hr\u0113\u00fem\u014dna\u00fe</i> is one of three events (apart from the days of the week) that refer to deities in the Anglo-Saxon calendar\u2014the other two being <i>\u0112osterm\u014dna\u00fe</i> and <i>M\u014ddraniht</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"De_temporum_ratione\"><i>De temporum ratione</i></span></h2>\n<p>In chapter 15 of his work <i>De temporum ratione</i>, Bede provides information about English months and celebrations. Bede records that <i>Hr\u0113\u00fem\u014dna\u00fe</i> is analogous to March, and details that \"Hrethmonath is named for their goddess Hretha, to whom they sacrificed at this time\" (<i>Rhed-monath a Dea illorum Rheda, cui in illo sacrificabant, nominatur\u2026</i>). Bede notes that <i>Hr\u0113\u00fem\u014dna\u00fe</i> occurs between <i>Solm\u014dna\u00fe</i> (February), so named due to the offerings of cakes to the gods during the month, and <i>\u0112osterm\u014dna\u00fe</i> (April), named after the goddess \u0112ostre.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Theories\">Theories</span></h2>\n<p>19th-century scholar Jacob Grimm notes, while no other source mentions the goddesses Rheda and \u0112ostre, saddling Bede, a \"father of the church, who everywhere keeps heathenism at a distance, and tells us less than he knows\" with the invention of the goddesses Rheda and \u0112ostre would be uncritical, and that \"there is nothing improbable in them, nay the first of them [Rheda] is justified by clear traces in the vocabularies of the German tribes.\" Grimm proposes a connection between <i>*Hr\u0113\u00fee</i> and the Old High German female personal name <i>Hruada</i>. Grimm theorizes that the Old High German form of the goddess name <i>Rheda</i> was <i>*Hrouda</i>.</p>\n<p>Rudolf Simek notes that Grimm's derivation of the name Rheda means that Rheda \"could have a similar meaning to the eponymous Roman god of the same month, Mars.\" David Raoul Wilson comments that while \"Bede gives us no clues as to the rituals involved during <i>Rhedmonath</i> and <i>Eosturmonath</i>, it is reasonable to assume that they related to the beginning of spring, the new growing season, and fertility.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modern_influence\">Modern influence</span></h2>\n<p>Appendix D of J. R. R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> contains a presentation of the Shire calendar, the calendar used by the fictional society of Hobbits. The calendar is generally based on the Anglo-Saxon one, and its third month is called \"Rethe\", modeled after <i>Hr\u0113\u00fem\u014dna\u00fe</i>, projected into the form the word would have taken in Modern English.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

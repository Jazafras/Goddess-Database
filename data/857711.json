Adapted via Buddhism from the Hindu goddess Lakshmi [and absorbing traits of the god Krishna] Kisshoutennyo is sometimes named as one of the Seven Gods of Fortune (<i>fukujin</i>), replacing either Jur\u014djin or Fukurokuju. For example, in the 1783 edition of the Butsuz\u014dzui compendium (reprinted in 1796), Kichij\u014dten replaces Fukurokuju as one of the seven fukujin. She is considered to be the goddess of happiness, fertility, and beauty. Kisshoutennyo's iconography is distinguished by the Nyoih\u014dju gem (\u5982\u610f\u5b9d\u73e0) in her hand.</p>\n<p>When Kisshoutennyo is counted among the seven fukujin and fellow fukujin Daikoku is regarded in feminine form, all three of the Hindu Tridevi goddesses are represented in the fukujin.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Kissh\u014d Tennyo (manga)</li>\n<li>Nyoih\u014dju (\u5982\u610f\u5b9d\u73e0) wishing gem</li>\n<li>Fukujin (\u798f\u795e) deities</li>\n<li>Buddhist Tenbu (\u5929\u90e8) deities</li>\n<li>Hinduism in Japan</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Amaterasu cave crop.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Commons-logo.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Daibutsu of Todaiji 4.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:IwashimizuHachimangu.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Japan-myth-stub.gif"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Jyoruriji Kissyoten Srii.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Kuniteru Gozu dragon.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}]}

She wears three wedding rings, one for each husband - Damballa, Agwe and Ogoun. Her symbol is a heart, her colours are pink, blue, white and gold, and her favourite sacrifices include jewellery, perfume, sweet cakes and liqueurs. Coquettish and very fond of beauty and finery, Erzulie Freda is femininity and compassion embodied, yet she also has a darker side; she is seen as jealous and spoiled and within some Vodoun circles is considered to be lazy. During ritual possession, she may enter the body of either a man or a woman. She enjoys the game of flirtation and seduces people without distinguishing between sexes. In Christian iconography she is often identified with the Mater Dolorosa, as well as another loa named, Metres Ezili. She is conceived of as never able to attain her heart's most fervent desire. For this reason she always leaves a service in tears. Common syncretizations include Iyalorde Oxum as she relates to the Yoruba Vodu goddess of Erotic Love, Gold and Femininity.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"\u00c8rzulie_Dant\u00f2r\"></span><span id=\".C3.88rzulie_Dant.C3.B2r\">\u00c8rzulie Dant\u00f2r</span></h2>\n<p>Erzulie Dant\u00f2r is the Queen of the Petro nation and the mother of \"Ti Jean Petro\", she is often depicted as a fearsome black woman, protectively holding \"Ti Jean Petro\" in her arms.

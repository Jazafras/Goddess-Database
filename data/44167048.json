She is mentioned in Nihongi, but not in Kojiki. She is also venerated at Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo and at Y\u014dr\u014d Shrine in Gifu Prefecture. Kukuri appears very briefly during the myth of Yomi, after Izanagi used the great god Michikaeshi \u014ckami to block the entry to Yomi no kuni. Her words are praised by Izanagi, but what she said to him was not recorded (or erased), which is strange, since Kukurihime is worship in 3000 shrines across Japan, and was latter merged with Kannon Bosatsu.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Brian Bocking, <i>A Popular Dictionary of Shinto</i> (Routledge, 2005).</li>\n<li>Stuart D.

Lucina was also an epithet for Juno. The name was generally taken to mean \"she who brings children into the light\" (Latin: <i>lux, lucis,</i> \"light\"), but may actually have been derived from <i>lucus</i> (\"grove\") after a sacred grove of lotus trees on the Esquiline Hill associated with the goddess, later the site of her temple. Her Greek equivalent was Eileithyia.</p>\n<p>Lucina was chief among a number of deities who influenced or guided every aspect of birth and child development, such as Vagitanus, who opened the newborn's mouth to cry, and Fabulinus, who enabled the child's first articulate speech. The collective <i>di nixi</i> were birth goddesses, and had an altar in the Campus Martius.</p>\n<p>The asteroid 146 Lucina and the extinct species of ostracod Luprisca incuba are named after the goddess.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>List of Roman birth and childhood deities</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Capitoline Wolf of Roman Kingdom.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}]}

In this work, the mythical origin of the land and sky, recounted in craggy verses from the <i>Kalevala</i>, becomes an intense Sibelian metaphor for the inexorable force\u2014even the terror of all creation\u2014including that of the artist. One of the composer's most compelling works, it alternates between two musical ideas. As heard at the outset, these are the shimmering stirrings of ever-growing possibility; and, underpinned with dissonant, static, harp strokes, the even more incantatory, distressed cries of the \"nature spirit\" (<i>Luonnotar</i>) herself, heavy with child.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_finance\">In finance</span></h2>\n<p>The Ilmatar Fund is an Eastern European multi-strategy hedge fund for investors.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:H\u00e9raldique meuble Soleil avec visage.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ilmatar.jpg"}]}

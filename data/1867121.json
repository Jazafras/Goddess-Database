When they were investigated again in 1390, however, they were charged with consorting with the Devil, condemned, and executed.</p>\n<p>While there is no evidence that the organized group described by the women actually existed, their testimonies are remarkably similar to those of several other groups in Italy and greater Europe, such as the followers of Richella and \"the wise Sibillia\" in 15th century Northern Italy, the Benandanti of 16th and 17th century Northern Italy, the <i>Armiers</i> of the Pyrenees, the Romanian C\u0103lu\u015fari, Livonian werewolves, Dalmatian <i>kresniki</i>, Hungarian <i>t\u00e1ltos</i> and Caucasian <i>burkudzauta</i>. These widespread repeated themes have been identified by historian Carlo Ginzburg as part of an ancient mythological complex probably originating from central Eurasia. The mythology of these groups has become a popular subject among adherents of modern witchcraft and Neopaganism.</p>\n<p>Ginzburg concluded that the name Madonna Oriente derives from the Latin <i>Domina Oriens</i>, a term for the Moon as a goddess.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Moon (mythology)</li>\n<li>Roman Inquisition of the 16th century</li>\n<li>witchcraft</li>\n<li>witch-hunt</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>Richard Kieckheffer, <i>Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century (Magic in History)</i>, page 155.

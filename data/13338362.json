The only evidence of her name to date is an altar set up at Vindolanda by its auxiliary garrison of the 4th cohort of Gauls, stationed there from the early 3rd century onwards. Its inscription reads:</p>\n<p>Of which a free translation would be \"The troops from Gaul dedicate this statue to the goddess Gallia with the full support of the British born troops\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>"}

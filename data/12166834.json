The formation of this theonym has been compared to that of Bellona, \"she who presides over war <i>(bellum)</i>\"; Pomona, \"she who presides over orchard fruits <i>(pomum)</i>\"; and Epona, the Romano-Celtic horse goddess (from Gaulish <i>epos</i>, \"horse\") whose image was placed in stables as a tutelary for the animals.</p>\n<p>Augustine mentions Bubona in two passages. In addition to the passage on theonyms and divine personifications, he lists her among several other deities who had specialized functions for the Romans, in contrast to the one god of the Jews.</p>\n<p>Georg Wissowa thought that a festival of cattle <i>(ludi boum causa)</i> mentioned by Pliny must have been dedicated to Bubona. Those who celebrated the rites were called <i>Bubetii</i>, a title which appears only in Pliny.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Classical_tradition\">Classical tradition</span></h2>\n<p>In the 18th century, formal gardens often featured sculptures of classical divinities, which were to be selected for the deity's suitability to the function of the area: Silvanus for a grove, for example, or Pomona for an orchard. Bubona was among those recommended for \"small paddocks of sheep.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg"}]}

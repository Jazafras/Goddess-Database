{"pageid": 3663977, "ns": 0, "title": "B\u00e9binn", "extract": "<p><b>B\u00e9binn</b> <span></span> a.k.a. <b>B\u00e9 Binn</b>, is an early Irish name applied to a number of related and unrelated figures in Irish mythology. In some sources <b>B\u00e9bhinn</b> (old orthography: B\u00e9\u1e03inn) is a goddess associated with birth and the sister of the river-goddess, Boann. B\u00e9binn is also described as being an underworld goddess in both Irish and Welsh mythology, inhabiting either the Irish underworld Mag Mell or the Welsh Annwn, although it is unknown which is the original source.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology_and_variations\">Etymology and variations</span></h2>\n<p>The name B\u00e9binn seems to be a combination between medieval forms of the Irish Gaelic word for \"woman\", \"bean\" (pronounced \"bahn\"), and the adjective \"melodious\", \"binn\", literally translating to \"melodious woman\". Other versions of the name, such as B\u00e9fionn, instead pair \"woman\" with \"fair\". Variant forms include B\u00e9 Bind, B\u00e9 Find, B\u00e9 Binn, Bebhinn, B\u00e9bhinn, B\u00e9bh\u00ednn, B\u00e9bhionn, B\u00e9bind, B\u00e9find and B\u00e9fionn. While it has also been Anglicized as Vivionn and Vivian, it is unrelated to the French or English names. In eighteenth-century Scottish writer James Macpherson's epic Ossian poems, the name appears as Vevina.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_mythology\">In mythology</span></h2>\n<p>B\u00e9binn is alternately described as either the wife of \u00c1ed Alainn, a god, or Idath, a mortal man. She is mentioned in multiple sources as the mother of Connacht hero Fr\u00e1ech, the main character in the <i>T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Fra\u00edch</i>. In the Fenian Cycle of Irish tales, B\u00e9binn is \"a beautiful giantess of aristocratic bearing\" who seeks protection from the Fianna when an ugly giant pursues her. In other sources a B\u00e9binn is mentioned as a daughter of Elcmar.</p>\n<p>The epithet B\u00e9 Find (\"Fair Woman\") is applied to the heroine \u00c9ta\u00edn by Midir in <i>Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne</i> (English: The Wooing of \u00c9ta\u00edn). The text includes a poem attributed to Midir, known as \"A B\u00e9 Find in ragha lium\". However, this poem may be an older composition unrelated to the \u00c9ta\u00edn story that was appended at a later time.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_history\">In history</span></h2>\n<p>The name B\u00e9binn and its variants is quite common in records from early Irish history, and was borne by historical as well as mythical figures, including a number of queens and abbesses. It was also the name High King Brian Boru's mother and one of his daughters.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bearers_of_the_name\">Bearers of the name</span></h2>\n<ul><li>B\u00e9 Binn inion Urchadh, Queen of Thomond, fl. c. 941.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn ingen Briain, died 1073.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn N\u00ed Briain, Queen of Ailech, died 1110.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn ingen Turgeis, died 1127/1134.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn N\u00ed Con Chaille, died 1134.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn N\u00ed Eochagain, died 1363.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn N\u00ed Ruairc, died 1367.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn N\u00ed Duinn, died 1376.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn N\u00ed Maolconaire, died 1391.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9 Binn N\u00ed Donnchada, died 1413.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9binn N\u00ed Donnchada, died 1413.</li>\n<li>B\u00e9binn N\u00ed Ruairc, died 1426.</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>List of Irish-language given names</li>\n<li>Bebhionn (moon)</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>http://medievalscotland.org/kmo/AnnalsIndex/Feminine/Bebinn.shtml</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:WPanthroponymy.svg"}]}

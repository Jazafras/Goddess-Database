{"pageid": 85676, "ns": 0, "title": "Veritas", "extract": "<p>In Roman mythology, <b>Veritas</b>, meaning <i>truth</i>, is the goddess of truth, a daughter of Chronos, the God of Time (who has been identified with Saturn-Cronus, perhaps first by Plutarch), and the mother of Virtus. She is also sometimes considered the daughter of Zeus, or a creation of Prometheus. It was believed that she hid in the bottom of a holy well because she was so elusive. Her image is shown as a young virgin dressed in white.</p>\n<p>Veritas is also the name given to the Roman virtue of truthfulness, which was considered one of the main virtues any good Roman should possess. The Greek goddess of truth is <b>Aletheia</b> (Ancient Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u1f00\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1</span>). The German philosopher Martin Heidegger argues that the truth represented by <i>aletheia</i> (which essentially means \"unconcealment\") is different from that represented by <i>veritas</i>, which is linked to a Roman understanding of rightness and finally to a Nietzschean sense of justice and a will to power. Veritas was often depicted nude, holding a hand mirror.</p>\n<p>In Western culture, the word may also serve as a motto.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mottos\">Mottos</span></h2>\n<p>This Latin word \"<i>veritas</i>\" now appears in the mottos of many colleges and universities.

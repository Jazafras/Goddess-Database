She is seated on a rooster, which symbolises innocence.</p>\n<p>One of the theory says that she is one of the goddesses in Sri Chakra. The real symbol of her vehicle is kurkut which means the serpent which has two mouths. Bahucharaji is seated on the low end and the other end goes to Sahasrara, which means that Bahucharaji is the goddess starting the awakening of kundalini which eventually leads the liberation or moksha.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Legend\">Legend</span></h2>\n<p>Bahuchara Mata was a warrior's daughter of the Charan caste. It is believed that Bahuchara Mata was travelling in a caravan when a marauder named Bapiya tried to molest her. Bahuchara Mata announced 'tragu', a form of self-immolation, and cut off her breasts, thus shedding her femininity. The marauder Bapiya was thereafter cursed with impotence. To attain penance Bapiya worshipped Bahuchara Mata by dressing and behaving as a woman, thus ultimately shedding his masculinity.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Temple\">Temple</span></h2>\n<p>Bahucharaji Temple is located in Bahucharaji town in Mehsana district of Gujarat, India.

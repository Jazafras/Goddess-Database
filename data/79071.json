Mythology personifies At\u00eb as the daughter either of Zeus or of Eris.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Classical_references\">Classical references</span></h2>\n<p>Homer's <i>Iliad</i> (Book 19) depicts At\u00eb as the eldest daughter of Zeus (with no mother mentioned). On Hera's instigation, At\u00eb used her influence over Zeus so that he swore an oath that on that day a mortal descended from him would be born who would become a great ruler. Hera immediately arranged to delay the birth of Heracles and to bring forth Eurystheus prematurely. In anger Zeus threw At\u00eb down to earth forever, forbidding her return to heaven or to Mt. Olympus. At\u00eb then wandered about, treading on the heads of men rather than on the earth, wreaking havoc on mortals.</p>\n<p>The Litae (\"Prayers\") follow after her, but At\u00eb is fast and far outruns them.</p>\n<p>The <i>Bibliotheca</i> (3.143) claims that when thrown down by Zeus, At\u00eb landed on a peak in Phrygia called by her name. There Ilus later, following a cow, founded the city of Ilion, known as Troy. This flourish is chronologically at odds with Homer's dating of At\u00eb's fall.</p>\n<p>Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i> (l.230) makes At\u00eb the daughter of Eris (\"Strife\"), with no father mentioned.</p>\n<p>In Nonnus' <i>Dionysiaca</i> (11.113), at Hera's instigation At\u00eb persuades the boy Ampelus whom Dionysus passionately loves, to impress Dionysus by riding on a bull from which Ampelus subsequently falls and breaks his neck.</p>\n<p>In the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes (4.817), Hera says that \"even the gods are sometimes visited by At\u00eb\" (translated by Richard Hunter as \"even gods make mistakes\").</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Post-classical\">Post-classical</span></h2>\n<p>In the play <i>Julius Caesar</i>, Shakespeare introduces the goddess At\u00eb as an invocation of vengeance and menace. Mark Antony, lamenting Caesar's murder, envisions:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>\"And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,<br></p>\n<p>With At\u00eb' by his side come hot from Hell,<br>\nShall in these confines with a monarch's voice<br>\nCry \"Havoc!\" and let slip the dogs of war ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shakespeare also mentions her in the play <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, when Benedick says, referring to Beatrice,</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>\"Come, talk not of her. You shall find her the<br>\ninfernal At\u00eb in good apparel ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So too, in <i>King John</i>, Shakespeare refers to Queen Eleanor as \"An Ate stirring [John] to blood and strife\" (2.1.63), and in Love's Labours Lost Birone jeers \"Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them on! stir them on!\" (5.2. 688-9).</p>\n<p>In her book <i>The March of Folly</i>, Barbara Tuchman notes that the earth has been called The Meadow of At\u00eb.</p>\n<p>In Spenser's <i>The Faerie Queene</i>, a fiend from Hell disguised as a beautiful woman is called Ate. This is a possible parallel to the fallen angels.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Folly (allegory)</li>\n<li>Lucifer</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Calasso, Roberto - <i>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i></li>\n<li>E.R.

Her name occurs as a surname of Venus.</p>\n<p>According to Livy she had a temple at the foot of the Aventine Hill near to the Palatine Hill. <i>Murcus</i> is said to have been an old name for the Aventine Hill itself; hence the adjective <i>murtius</i> (= <i>murcius</i>) was applied to the turning-posts of the Circus Maximus, which was also situated in a valley between the Aventine and the Palatine Hills.</p>\n<p>The name Murcia was linked to the name of the myrtle tree (Latin <i>myrtus</i>) by folk etymology; hence the spellings Murtia and Murtea. This association with myrtle, which was a sign of Venus, led to her naming as \"Venus of the Myrtles\". Christian writers, in their turn, connected Murcia with the adjective <i>murcus</i> or <i>murcidus</i> \"lazy, inactive\", thus interpreting her as a \"goddess of sloth and laziness\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Myth Index - Murcia</li>\n</ul><p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}]}

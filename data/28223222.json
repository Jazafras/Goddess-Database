The legend is set in Vishnupur or Bishnupur (in the present West Bengal), the seat of the Mallabhum kingdom from 7th century AD to 19th century during the period of Malla kings who belonged to Bagdi caste (Barga Kshatriya). The queen had a friend belonging to Mochi caste who ate beef. The queen was horrified to learn this, out of curiosity the queen wanted to see the meat. One day, the queen asked her friend to show it to her. The girl initially refused, fearing the wrath of the pious Hindu king, however later she complied with the queen's request. However, the queen got betrayed and the furious king rushed to kill her. The queen hid the meat in her clothes and prayed to goddess Durga for help. Subsequently when the king tore her clothes to find what was hidden beneath them, all he could find there was a red jaba flower (hibiscus). Even today the goddess's puja remains part of women\u2019s rites and is performed for the goddess' intervention during a family crisis.</p>\n<p>Like some other manifestations of Durga, who are invoked during time of specific crisis, or to help an ailing family member, Bipadtarini is also prayed as \"cure deity\".

She is the daughter of Nyx, the goddess of night and the twin of the god Momos. Her Latin name is Miseria, from which the English word 'misery' is derived. She is also the older sister of the Greek personification of the day, Hemera. She is a minor goddess without a great cult following, but a primordial goddess of misery and depression with a certain amount of mythological weight nonetheless.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Altes Museum - Antikensammlung 058.JPG"}]}

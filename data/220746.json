While she is often seen as the only female among the Eight Immortals, the sex of Lan Caihe, another of the Eight Immortals, is somewhat ambiguous. He Xiangu is believed to have lived in the Tang dynasty and was born in either Lingling District, Yongzhou, Hunan or Zengcheng District, Guangzhou, Guangdong.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Legend\">Legend</span></h2>\n<p>According to the <i>Xian Fo Qi Zong</i> (\u4ed9\u4f5b\u5947\u8e64), He Xian'gu was the daughter of He Tai (\u4f55\u6cf0), a man from Zengcheng District, Guangzhou, Guangdong. At birth, she had six long hairs on the crown of her head. When she was about 14 or 15, a divine personage appeared to her in a dream and instructed her to eat powdered mica so that her body might become etherealised and immune from death. She did as instructed, vowed to remain a virgin, and gradually decreased her food intake.</p>\n<p>Wu Zetian once sent a messenger to summon He Xian'gu to the imperial court, but she disappeared on the way there.</p>\n<p>One day during the Jinglong era (707\u2013710 CE) in the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of the Tang dynasty, she ascended to Heaven in broad daylight and became an immortal.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Depiction\">Depiction</span></h2>\n<p>He Xian'gu's lotus flower improves one's health, mental and physical.

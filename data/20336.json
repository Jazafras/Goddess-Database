{"pageid": 20336, "ns": 0, "title": "The Morr\u00edgan", "extract": "<p><b>The Morr\u00edgan</b> (\"phantom queen\") or <b>M\u00f3rr\u00edgan</b> (\"great queen\"), also known as <b>Morr\u00edgu</b>, is a figure from Irish mythology. The name is spelled <b>Morr\u00edghan</b> or <b>M\u00f3r-R\u00edoghain</b> in Modern Irish.</p>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan is mainly associated with war and fate, especially with foretelling doom and death in battle. In this role she often appears as a crow, the <i>badb</i>. She is also associated with sovereignty, the land and livestock. She is believed to be a manifestation of the earth- and sovereignty-goddess, chiefly representing the goddess's role as guardian of the territory and its people.</p>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan is often described as a trio of individuals, all sisters, called 'the three Morr\u00edgna'. Membership of the triad varies; sometimes it is given as Badb, Macha and Nemain while elsewhere it is given as Badb, Macha and Anand (the latter is given as another name for the Morr\u00edgan). It is believed that these were all names for the same goddess. The three Morr\u00edgna are also named as sisters of the three land goddesses \u00c9riu, Banba and F\u00f3dla.</p>\n<p>She is associated with the banshee of later folklore.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>There is some disagreement over the meaning of the Morr\u00edgan's name. <i>Mor</i> may derive from an Indo-European root connoting terror or monstrousness, cognate with the Old English <i>maere</i> (which survives in the modern English word \"nightmare\") and the Scandinavian <i>mara</i> and the Old East Slavic \"mara\" (\"nightmare\"); while <i>r\u00edgan</i> translates as 'queen'. This can be reconstructed in the Proto-Celtic language as *<i>Moro-r\u012bgan\u012b-s</i>. Accordingly, <i>Morr\u00edgan</i> is often translated as \"Phantom Queen\". This is the derivation generally favoured in current scholarship.</p>\n<p>In the Middle Irish period the name is often spelled <i>M\u00f3rr\u00edgan</i> with a lengthening diacritic over the <i>o</i>, seemingly intended to mean \"Great Queen\" (Old Irish <i>m\u00f3r</i>, 'great'; this would derive from a hypothetical Proto-Celtic *<i>M\u0101ra R\u012bgan\u012b-s</i>). Whitley Stokes believed this latter spelling was due to a false etymology popular at the time. There have also been attempts by modern writers to link the Morr\u00edgan with the Welsh literary figure Morgan le Fay from the Matter of Britain, in whose name <i>mor</i> may derive from Welsh word for \"sea\", but the names are derived from different cultures and branches of the Celtic linguistic tree.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Glosses_and_glossaries\">Glosses and glossaries</span></h3>\n<p>The earliest sources for the Morr\u00edgan are glosses in Latin manuscripts, and glossaries (collections of glosses). In a 9th century manuscript containing the Vulgate version of the Book of Isaiah, the word <i>Lamia</i> is used to translate the Hebrew <i>Lilith</i>. A gloss explains this as \"a monster in female form, that is, a <i>morr\u00edgan</i>\". <i>Cormac's Glossary</i> (also 9th century), and a gloss in the later manuscript H.3.18, both explain the plural word <i>gudemain</i> (\"spectres\") with the plural form <i>morr\u00edgna</i>. The 8th century <i>O'Mulconry's Glossary</i> says that Macha is one of the three <i>morr\u00edgna</i>.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ulster_Cycle\">Ulster Cycle</span></h3>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan's earliest narrative appearances, in which she is depicted as an individual, are in stories of the Ulster Cycle, where she has an ambiguous relationship with the hero C\u00fa Chulainn. In <i>T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Regamna</i> (<i>The Cattle Raid of Regamain</i>), C\u00fachulainn encounters the Morr\u00edgan, but does not recognise her, as she drives a heifer from his territory. In response to this perceived challenge, and his ignorance of her role as a sovereignty figure, he insults her. But before he can attack her she becomes a black bird on a nearby branch. C\u00fachulainn now knows who she is, and tells her that had he known before, they would not have parted in enmity. She notes that whatever he had done would have brought him ill luck. To his response that she cannot harm him, she delivers a series of warnings, foretelling a coming battle in which he will be killed. She tells him, \"it is at the guarding of thy death that I am; and I shall be.\"</p>\n<p>In the <i>T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge</i> queen Medb of Connacht launches an invasion of Ulster to steal the bull Donn Cuailnge; the Morr\u00edgan, like Alecto of the Greek Furies, appears to the bull in the form of a crow and warns him to flee. C\u00fachulainn defends Ulster by fighting a series of single combats at fords against Medb's champions. In between combats the Morr\u00edgan appears to him as a young woman and offers him her love, and her aid in the battle, but he rejects her offer. In response she intervenes in his next combat, first in the form of an eel who trips him, then as a wolf who stampedes cattle across the ford, and finally as a white, red-eared heifer leading the stampede, just as she had warned in their previous encounter. However C\u00fachulainn wounds her in each form and defeats his opponent despite her interference. Later she appears to him as an old woman bearing the same three wounds that her animal forms sustained, milking a cow. She gives C\u00fachulainn three drinks of milk. He blesses her with each drink, and her wounds are healed. He regrets blessing her for the three drinks of milk which is apparent in the exchange between the Morr\u00edgan and C\u00fachulainn, \"She gave him milk from the third teat, and her leg was healed. 'You told me once,' she said,'that you would never heal me.' 'Had I known it was you,' said C\u00fachulainn, 'I never would have.'\" As the armies gather for the final battle, she prophesies the bloodshed to come.</p>\n<p>In one version of C\u00fachulainn's death-tale, as C\u00fachulainn rides to meet his enemies, he encounters the Morr\u00edgan as a hag washing his bloody armour in a ford, an omen of his death. Later in the story, mortally wounded, C\u00fachulainn ties himself to a standing stone with his own entrails so he can die upright, and it is only when a crow lands on his shoulder that his enemies believe he is dead.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mythological_Cycle\">Mythological Cycle</span></h3>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan also appears in texts of the Mythological Cycle. In the 12th century pseudohistorical compilation <i>Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn</i> she is listed among the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann as one of the daughters of Ernmas, granddaughter of Nuada.</p>\n<p>The first three daughters of Ernmas are given as \u00c9riu, Banba, and F\u00f3dla. Their names are synonyms for Ireland, and they were married to Mac Cuill, Mac C\u00e9cht, and Mac Gr\u00e9ine, the last three Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann kings of Ireland. Associated with the land and kingship, they probably represent a triple goddess of sovereignty. Next come Ernmas's other three daughters: Badb, Macha, and the Morr\u00edgan. A quatrain describes the three as wealthy, \"springs of craftiness\" and \"sources of bitter fighting\". The Morr\u00edgu's name is also said to be Anand, and she had three sons, Glon, Gaim, and Coscar. According to Geoffrey Keating's 17th century <i>History of Ireland</i>, \u00c9riu, Banba, and F\u00f3dla worshipped Badb, Macha, and the Morr\u00edgan respectively.</p>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan also appears in <i>Cath Maige Tuired</i> \"Battle of Mag Tuired\". On Samhain, she keeps a tryst with the Dagda before the battle against the Fomorians. When he meets her she is washing herself, standing with one foot on either side of the river Unius. In some sources she is believed to have created the river. After they have sex, the Morr\u00edgan promises to summon the magicians of Ireland to cast spells on behalf of the Tuatha D\u00e9, and to destroy Indech, the Fomorian king, taking from him \"the blood of his heart and the kidneys of his valour\". Later, we are told, she would bring two handfuls of his blood and deposit them in the same river (however, we are also told later in the text that Indech was killed by Ogma).</p>\n<p>As battle is about to be joined, the Tuatha D\u00e9 leader, Lug, asks each what power they bring to the battle. The Morr\u00edgan's reply is difficult to interpret, but involves pursuing, destroying and subduing. When she comes to the battlefield she chants a poem, and immediately the battle breaks and the Fomorians are driven into the sea. After the battle she chants another poem celebrating the victory and prophesying the end of the world.</p>\n<p>In another story she lures away the bull of a woman named Odras. Odras then follows the Morr\u00edgan to the Otherworld, via the cave of Cruachan. When Odras falls asleep, the Morr\u00edgan turns her into a pool of water that fed into the Shannon River.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Nature_and_role\">Nature and role</span></h2>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan is often considered a triple goddess, but this triple nature is ambiguous and inconsistent. These triple appearances are partially due to the Celtic significance of threeness. Sometimes she appears as one of three sisters, the daughters of Ernmas: Morr\u00edgan, Badb and Macha. Sometimes the trinity consists of Badb, Macha and Anand, collectively known as the <i>Morr\u00edgna</i>. Occasionally Nemain or Fea appear in the various combinations. However, the Morr\u00edgan can also appear alone, and her name is sometimes used interchangeably with Badb.</p>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan is mainly associated with war and fate, and is often interpreted as a \"war goddess\". W. M. Hennessy's \"The Ancient Irish Goddess of War\", written in 1870, was influential in establishing this interpretation. Her role often involves premonitions of a particular warrior's violent death, suggesting a link with the banshee of later folklore. This connection is further noted by Patricia Lysaght: \"In certain areas of Ireland this supernatural being is, in addition to the name banshee, also called the <i>badhb</i>\". Her role was to not only be a symbol of imminent death, but to also influence the outcome of war. Most often she did this by appearing as a crow flying overhead and would either inspire fear or courage in the hearts of the warriors. In some cases, she is written to have appeared in visions to those who are destined to die in battle by washing their bloody armor. In this specific role, she is also given the role of foretelling imminent death with a particular emphasis on the individual. There are also a few rare accounts where she would join in the battle itself as a warrior and show her favouritism in a more direct manner.</p>\n<p>The Morr\u00edgan is also associated with the land and animals, particularly livestock. M\u00e1ire Herbert argues that \"war <i>per se</i> is not a primary aspect of the role of the goddess\". Herbert suggests that \"her activities have a tutelary character. She oversees the land, its stock and its society. Her shape-shifting is an expression of her affinity with the whole living universe\". Patricia Lysaght notes that <i>Cath Maige Tuired</i> depicts the Morr\u00edgan as \"a protectress of her people's interests\" and it associates her with both war and fertility. According to Prionsias Mac Cana, the goddess in Ireland is \"primarily concerned with the prosperity of the land: its fertility, its animal life, and (when it is conceived as a political unit) its security against external forces\". Likewise, Maria Tymoczko writes \"The welfare and fertility of a people depend on their security against external aggression\" and notes that \"Warlike action can thus have a protective aspect\". It is therefore suggested that the Morr\u00edgan is a manifestation of the earth- and sovereignty-goddess, chiefly representing the goddess's role as guardian of the territory and its people. She can be interpreted as providing political or military aid, or protection to the king\u2014acting as a goddess of sovereignty, not necessarily of war.</p>\n<p>It has also been suggested that she was closely linked to the <i>fianna</i> and that these groups may have been in some way dedicated to her. These were \"bands of youthful warrior-hunters, living on the borders of civilized society and indulging in lawless activities for a time before inheriting property and taking their places as members of settled, landed communities\". If true, her worship may have resembled that of Perchta groups in Germanic areas.</p>\n<p>There is a burnt mound site in County Tipperary known as <i>Fulacht na M\u00f3r R\u00edoghna</i> ('cooking pit of the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan'). The fulachta\u00ed sites are found in wild areas, and usually associated with outsiders such as the fianna, as well as with the hunting of deer. There may be a link with the three mythical hags who cook the meal of dogflesh that brings the hero C\u00fachulainn to his doom. The <i>D\u00e1 Chich na Morrigna</i> ('two breasts of the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan'), a pair of hills in County Meath, suggest to some a role as a tutelary goddess, comparable to Anu, who has her own hills, <i>D\u00e1 Ch\u00edch Anann</i> ('the breasts of Anu') in County Kerry. Other goddesses known to have similar hills are \u00c1ine and Grian of County Limerick who, in addition to a tutelary function, also have solar attributes.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Arthurian_legend\">Arthurian legend</span></h2>\n<p>There have been attempts by some modern authors of fiction to link Morgan le Fay with the Morr\u00edgan. Morgan first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's <i>Vita Merlini</i> \"The Life of Merlin\" in the 12th century. In these Arthurian legends, such as <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>, Morgan is portrayed as an evil hag whose actions set into motion a bloody trail of events that lead the hero into numerous instances of danger. Morgan is also depicted as a seductress, much like the older legends of the goddess and has numerous sexual encounters with Merlin. The character is frequently depicted of wielding power over others to achieve her own purposes, allowing those actions to play out over time, to either the benefit or detriment of other characters.</p>\n<p>However, while the creators of the literary character of Morgan may have been somewhat inspired by the much older tales of the goddess, the relationship ends there. Scholars such as Rosalind Clark hold that the names are unrelated, the Welsh \"Morgan\" (Wales being the source of the Matter of Britain) being derived from root words associated with the sea, while the Irish \"Morr\u00edgan\" has its roots either in a word for \"terror\" or a word for \"greatness\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modern_depictions\">Modern depictions</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Bean nighe</li>\n<li>Cl\u00edodhna</li>\n<li>Mongfind</li>\n<li>Sc\u00e1thach</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Rosalind Clark, <i>The Great Queens: Irish Goddesses from the Morr\u00edgan to Cathleen N\u00ed Houlihan</i> (Irish Literary Studies, Book 34)</li>\n<li>Barry Cunliffe, <i>The Ancient Celts</i></li>\n<li>Miriam Robbins Dexter, <i>Whence the Goddesses: A Source Book</i></li>\n<li>James MacKillop, <i>Dictionary of Celtic Mythology</i></li>\n<li>Daithi O hOgain, <i>Myth, Legend and Romance: An Encyclopedia of the Irish Folk Tradition</i> Prentice Hall Press, (1991)\u00a0: ISBN\u00a00-13-275959-4</li>\n<li>Anne Ross, <i>Pagan Celtic Britain: Studies in Iconography</i></li>\n<li>Anne Ross, \"The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts\", in V.

They were probably the same deity as Yohaulticetl and Coyolxauhqui and the male moon god Tecciztecatl; like the latter, they feared the sun because they feared its fire. Also referred to as the lowly god of worms who failed to sacrifice himself to become the sun, and became the moon instead, his face darkened by a rabbit.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Otomi_mythology\">Otomi mythology</span></h2>\n<p>For the Otomi people, Z\u00e4na was the Moon, the Queen of the Night, probably the main deity. They called her the Old Mother, who represented both Moon and Earth simultaneously. Her spouse, the Old Father, was the god of fire. The Otomi counted lunar months as a period from new moon to new moon. They were giving every month 30 days.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mexican_traces\">Mexican traces</span></h2>\n<p>The origin of the name of the Mexica probably derived from Metztli. For more detailed explanation see Toponymy of Mexico.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Legend\">Legend</span></h2>\n<p>The Moon and Sun were at one time equally bright. It not being appropriate for gods to be equals, one of them threw a rabbit in the face of the other, and the one struck darkened to become today's moon. Henceforth it's possible to distinguish a figure of a rabbit on the moon's surface. During a full moon, the \"Rabbit in the Moon\" becomes readily visible.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Black Sun (mythology)</li>\n<li>Mextli</li>\n<li>Tecciztecatl</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation book\">Galindo Trejo, Jes\u00fas (1994). <i>Arqueoastronom\u00eda en la am\u00e9rica antigua</i>.

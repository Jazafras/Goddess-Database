The name of the Germanic soldiers \"Tuihantis\" also attests to this connection with the one-handed sword god Tiw.</p>\n<p>The second inscription reads: DEABVS ALAISIAGIS BAVDIHILLIE ET FRIAGABI ET N(umini) AVG(usti) N(umerus) HNAVDIFRIDI V(otum) S(olvit) L(ibens) M(erito)</p>\n<ul><li>These goddesses are possibly recorded on two inscriptions in Greek recorded in <i>l'Ann\u00e9e \u00c9pigraphique</i> for 1973.</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Syncretism\">Syncretism</span></h2>\n<p>The goddesses called the Alaisiagae are named on altar-stones from the same fort on Hadrian's Wall as being parallel with two Germanic goddesses: Celtic <i>Boudihillia</i> is equated with Germanic <i>Fimmilena</i> and Celtic <i>Beda</i> is equated with Germanic <i>Friagabis</i>. These parallel goddesses are taken to be Germanic not only because of clues in the inscriptions and the Germanic mercenaries at the wall at the time, but also because they both have an initial \u2018f-,\u2019 a sound not known to have developed in Celtic at this time. Equally, the two goddesses are not known to be Roman. Beda may have been an abbreviation for Ricagambeda since the two names share similar semantics. Boudihillia and Beda are more likely Celtic names however.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Archeological_setting\">Archeological setting</span></h2>\n<p>The altar stones of the Alaisiagae were recovered in the Temple of Mars at Vercovicium. This roughly circular temple was found on top of Chapel Hill a little to the south of the fort, its walls of undressed stone facing with an earth and rubble infill enclosed an area measuring about 17\u00bc ft. across; the insubstantial foundations indicate that the superstructure was at least half-timbered. The temple was built in the early-3rd century upon the ruins of a rectangular workshop in the <i>vicus</i> which had been destroyed during the barbarian incursions of AD196. It contained altars dedicated by the commanders and men of all three units known to be stationed at Vercovicium to the god Mars Thincsus, the Romanized aspect of a Teutonic god, a common occurrence among the Roman auxiliary units. Various altars have been found at this site dedicated to Mars and/or to the Celto-Germanic goddesses Alaisiagae; named on one altar as Beda and Fimmilena, on another as Boudihillia and Friagabis.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p><b>Boudihillia</b> can be derived from the Proto-Celtic <i>*B\u014dud-\u012b-h\u012bl\u012bj\u0101</i> meaning 'victory\u2019s fullness.' <b>Beda</b> is derived from the Proto-Celtic <i>*Bed-\u0101</i> meaning 'burial.' <b>Alaisiagae</b> is derived from the Proto-Celtic <i>*Ad-l\u0101js\u012bj\u0101-agai</i> meaning (in the illative) 'sending fears,' plausibly a byword for a notion of \u201cdispatching terrors\u201d (q.v.

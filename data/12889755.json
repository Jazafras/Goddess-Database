Watching over the needs of the people in the nearby town, she used to regularly leave fruits and animals at the doorstep of locals who needed food during hard times. At one point, though, a group of young men got greedy. They sought out where Sinukuan\u2019s home was in the mountains, and when they found it, they asked for more than what they actually needed. Sinukuan did not object to this, and allowed them to pick a great load of fruits. She warned them, however, not to get any fruits from the forest without her permission. On their way back home, they decided they would get more. Why not? They asked each other. \u201cShe won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference.\" But she did. As soon as they had started picking more fruit, their packs began to feel heavier. They soon discovered that all the fruit and meat they were carrying had turned into rocks. The young men ran away, but before they managed to escape the forest, Sinukuan appeared before them. As punishment, she said, she would turn them into swine. And so she did.</p>\n<p>But the other people in the village were also getting greedy. More and more, they stole from Sinukuan\u2019s forests. Angered, Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She made the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. And she also never allowed the villagers to see her again.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Appearance\">Appearance</span></h2>\n<p>Local tradition describes Sinukuan thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Her black hair\u2026 naturally curled, reaches down to her ankles.

She belongs to a family of similar beings of destiny and fate, which have given us various modern concepts (such as Aesa, Moira, Moros, Ananke, Adrasteia and Pepromene).</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>Heimarmene's name is an ontological description of how she was seen. It is speculated to be a participial form of the Greek verb <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9</span> (<i>meiresthai</i>, meaning \"to receive as one's lot\"), which is derived from the same root as Moira (\"fate\"). It is likely that both are correct.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Other_uses\">Other uses</span></h2>\n<p>The term \"Heimarmene\" (personified or not) is also widely used in the Greek Stoic tradition, the Gnostic religion (such as in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> manuscript), and other obscure religious sects.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Inline_citations\">Inline citations</span></h3>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Sources_referenced\">Sources referenced</span></h3>\n<ul><li>http://stoicspirit.blogspot.com/2007/05/cosmology-of-ancient-stoa.html</li>\n<li>http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Moirai.html</li>\n<li>http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1478.html</li>\n<li>The Moirai/Moirae (The Fates)</li>\n<li>Cosmology of the Stoa</li>\n<li>Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, v. 2, page 370</li>\n<li>Greek and Roman religion: a source book</li>\n<li>Physics of the Stoics, by Samuel Sambursky</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>In works of Josephus</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Altes Museum - Antikensammlung 058.JPG"}]}

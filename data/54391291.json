It is one of the main branches of the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sampradaya (lit.: \u2018Tradition of Bengali worshipers of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019), which started with \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu.</p>\n<p>Advaita Pariv\u0101ra is a branch of the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava tradition, a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-worshiping devotional subsect of Hinduism, founded by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (Vi\u015bvambhara Mi\u015bra, 1486-1534), who was Himself invoked to appear in this world by \u015ar\u012b Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya (Kamal\u0101k\u1e63a Mi\u015bra, not related, 1434-1559). Not only was Advaita responsible for the invocation of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya, he was also seen as the choreographer of the l\u012bl\u0101, or divine activities of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya, as well as being the establisher of his own lineage of devotional teachers (guru-parampar\u0101).</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pariv\u0101ra\"></span><span id=\"Pariv.C4.81ra\">Pariv\u0101ra</span></h2>\n<p>Pariv\u0101ra means \u2018family\u2019 or \u2018followers\u2019. in Sanskrit, and more particularly \u2018family\u2019 in Hindi and Bengali. A pariv\u0101ra is a family of descendants from a divine personality named \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019, literally \u2018descent of God\u2019. This family gives spiritual initiation to its followers, who often start their own branches of the tradition. Thus there are two types of pariv\u0101ras, a va\u1e41\u015ba parampar\u0101, or family succession (parampar\u0101 means \u2018one after the other\u2019), and a d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 parampar\u0101, or initiation succession, a succession of followers not related to the family by birth but through initiation only.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Advaita_Pariv\u0101ra\"></span><span id=\"Advaita_Pariv.C4.81ra\">Advaita Pariv\u0101ra</span></h2>\n<p>\u015ar\u012b Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya was born in a Brahmin family in \u015ar\u012b Ha\u1e6d\u1e6da, currently named Sylhet, a city and region in the present day Bangladesh, as the son of Pandit Kuver \u0100c\u0101rya and his wife N\u0101bh\u0101 Devi, in the year 1434. Out of compassion for the fallen souls of the age of Kali He invoked the avat\u0101ra or descent of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His most munificent form of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who took birth in the town of Navadv\u012bpa in 1486. Thus \u015ar\u012b Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya is famous as gaur \u0101n\u0101 \u1e6dh\u0101kura (\u0997\u09cc\u09b0 \u0986\u09a8\u09be \u09a0\u09be\u0995\u09c1\u09b0). The advaita pariv\u0101ra was originally promulgated by the two married sons of \u015ar\u012b Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Mi\u015bra Gosw\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012b Balar\u0101m Mi\u015bra Gosw\u0101m\u012b. \u015ar\u012b Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya had four more sons, Acyut\u0101nanda, Gop\u0101l, Jagad\u012b\u015ba and Svar\u016bpa, but they became sanny\u0101s\u012bs (monks), travelled and did not accept disciples.</p>\n<p>The most famous descendant of \u015ar\u012b Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya is certainly Bijoy Krishna Goswami (1841-1899), whose hagiography is described in a multi-volume set in Bengali by his disciple Kuladananda Brahmacari.</p>\n<p>Until recently the Advaita Pariv\u0101ra was chiefly active in the greater Bengal (the east-Indian state of West Bengal and adjacent Bangladesh) having pockets of followers in the Vrindavan area in Uttar Pradesh as well as in the far east of India. More recently it has become active also outside of India, having initiated its first non-Indian follower in 1982.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Foundation_of_Advaita_Pariv\u0101ra\"></span><span id=\"Foundation_of_Advaita_Pariv.C4.81ra\">Foundation of Advaita Pariv\u0101ra</span></h2>\n<p>The \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101 of Caitanya Carit\u0101m\u1e5bta describes the branches of the Caitanya-tree, referring to the disciplic successions that have descended from \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s eternal associates, starting with Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu. Chapter 12, verses 1-76, are dedicated to the dvit\u012bya skandha, or second branch of the Caitanya-tree \u2013 v\u1e5bk\u1e63era dvit\u012bya skandha \u2013 \u0101c\u0101rya gos\u0101i (12.4). In the beginning of the description it is mentioned that there was a schism in the early days of this branch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prathamete eka mata \u0101c\u0101ryera ga\u1e47a; p\u0101che dui mata hoilo daivera k\u0101ra\u1e47a</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>keho to \u0101c\u0101ryera \u0101j\u00f1\u0101ya keho to svatantra; sva mata kalpan\u0101 kore daiva paratantra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u0101c\u0101ryera mata yei, sei mata s\u0101ra; t\u0101ra \u0101j\u00f1\u0101 langha cole, sei to as\u0101ra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At first the whole family agreed with the \u0100c\u0101rya (Advaita), but later, due to Fate, there were two opinions. Some obeyed the \u0100c\u0101rya, while others became independent and concocted their own opinions, by the force of Fate. The opinion of the \u0100c\u0101rya is the essence while those who disobeyed His opinion are useless. (\u0100di 12.8-10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of Advaita\u2019s six sons, three are understood to be the obedient ones. Caitanya Carit\u0101m\u1e5bta describes the three obedient sons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Acyut\u0101nanda \u2013 bo\u1e5bo \u015b\u0101kh\u0101, \u0101c\u0101rya nandana; \u0101janma sevil\u0101 tiho caitanya-cara\u1e47a</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Acyut\u0101nanda was a strong branch, he was a son of (Advaita) \u0100c\u0101rya \u2013 he served the feet of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya from his very birth. (\u0100di 12.13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mi\u015bra n\u0101ma \u0101ra \u0101c\u0101rya tanoy; caitanya gos\u0101i boise j\u0101h\u0101r h\u1e5bdoy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another son of the \u0100c\u0101rya was named K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Mi\u015bra \u2013 Lord Caitanya sat in his heart. (\u0100di 12.18)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And thirdly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u015ar\u012b gop\u0101la name \u0101ra \u0101c\u0101ryera suta \u2018Another son of the \u0100c\u0101rya is named \u015ar\u012b Gop\u0101la\u2019. (\u0100di 12.19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The three disobedient sons are named afterwards:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u0100c\u0101ryera \u0101ra putra \u2013 \u015br\u012b balar\u0101ma; \u0100ra putra svar\u016bpa \u015b\u0101kh\u0101 jagad\u012b\u015ba n\u0101ma</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Balar\u0101ma, Svar\u016bpa and Jagad\u012b\u015ba are the names of the \u0100c\u0101rya\u2019s other sons (\u0100di 12.27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta does not want to label them as apostates, though (as\u0101rera name ih\u0101 n\u0101hi prayojana, \u0100di 12.11). It is significant that Caitanya Carit\u0101m\u1e5bta first mentions the offspring of Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya before mentioning His d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-descendants. It shows the prominence of the va\u1e41\u015ba parampar\u0101, or family succession, of Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Prominent_Founder_Members\">Prominent Founder Members</span></h2>\n<p>\u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015b\u0101na N\u0101gar was the personal servant of Advaita Prabhu. He was adopted by Advaita Prabhu at the age of 5 and served Advaita Prabhu until the age of 70. He was a lifelong witness to the extraordinary pastimes of \u015ar\u012b Advaita Prabhu and wrote a comprehensive hagiography of Advaita Prabhu named \u2018Advaita Prakash\u2019. In the 12th chapter of this 22-chapter book he states that the famous Lokan\u0101tha Gosw\u0101m\u012b, the Guru of Narottam D\u0101s \u1e6ch\u0101kura Mah\u0101\u015baya, was a disciple of Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya, and in chapter 7 he states that Harid\u0101s \u1e6ch\u0101kura received harin\u0101ma from Him and also \u1e0dora-kaupin, initiation into the life of a monk.</p>\n<p>Returning to Caitanya-Carit\u0101m\u1e5bta \u0100di chapter 12, a list of prominent disciples of Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya is given towards the end of that chapter. First of all, at 12.56-57, there is \u015ar\u012b Yadunandan-\u0101c\u0101rya, who was the Guru of the illustrious \u015ar\u012bla Raghun\u0101tha D\u0101sa Gosw\u0101m\u012b (see Vil\u0101pa Kusum\u0101njali, verse 4), then, at 12.83, \u015ar\u012bn\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, who wrote a commentary to \u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavata named Caitanya-mata-manju\u1e63\u0101, and who became the guru of Kavi Kar\u1e47ap\u016bra. Then there is Bh\u0101gavat\u0101c\u0101rya \u015ay\u0101mad\u0101s, who is mentioned both in Caitanya Carit\u0101m\u1e5bta and in Advaita Prak\u0101\u015ba, who was defeated by Advaita Prabhu in a scholarly debate, then studied \u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavata under Advaita Prabhu, after which he received the title Bh\u0101gavat\u0101c\u0101rya. He later also arranged Advaita Prabhu\u2019s marriage. Advaita Prabhu also initiated king Divyasi\u1e41ha, the king of Lau\u1e0da, His father\u2019s employer. Caitanya Carit\u0101m\u1e5bta concludes the description of the Advaita Skandha or Pariv\u0101ra with a long list of more of Advaita Prabhu\u2019s most prominent disciples \u2013 Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u0101sa \u0100c\u0101rya, Cakrap\u0101\u1e47i \u0100c\u0101rya, Ananta \u0100c\u0101rya, Nandin\u012b, K\u0101madeva, Caitanya D\u0101s, Durllabh Vi\u015bv\u0101sa, Vanam\u0101li D\u0101s, Jagann\u0101th and Bhavan\u0101th Kor, H\u1e5bday\u0101nanda Sen, Bhol\u0101n\u0101th D\u0101s, Y\u0101dav D\u0101s, Vijay D\u0101s, Jan\u0101rdan, Ananta D\u0101s, K\u0101nu Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a D\u0101s, \u015ar\u012bvatsa Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, Harid\u0101s Brahmac\u0101r\u012b, Puru\u1e63ottam Brahmac\u0101r\u012b, Puru\u1e63ottam Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, Raghun\u0101th, Vanam\u0101li Kavicandra, Vaidyan\u0101th, Lokan\u0101th Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit (this may be Lokan\u0101th Gosw\u0101m\u012b), Mur\u0101ri Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, \u015ar\u012b Hari-Cara\u1e47a, M\u0101dhava Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, Vijay Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit, and \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Schisms\">Schisms</span></h2>\n<p>Two major schisms took place in the Advaita Pariv\u0101ra even in Advaita Prabhu\u2019s lifetime. Once Advaita Prabhu preached j\u00f1\u0101na (non-dualism) to attract \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s attention, but He declared to his followers that it was just a ruse. Some devotees, however, kept Him to this j\u00f1\u0101na v\u0101da, despite of it, and were rejected. This is described in Advaita Prak\u0101\u015ba, chapter 21.</p>\n<p>Another schism took place among the sons of Advaita \u0100c\u0101ry. Three of His sons; Balar\u0101ma, Svar\u016bpa and Jagad\u012b\u015ba were angry when their brother K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Mi\u015bra received the temple service of Advaita Prabhu\u2019s deity Madangop\u0101la \u2013 they left and established their own deity services elsewhere. This is described in Advaita Prak\u0101\u015ba, chapter 21</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Two_Branches_of_Advaita_Pariv\u0101ra\"></span><span id=\"Two_Branches_of_Advaita_Pariv.C4.81ra\">Two Branches of Advaita Pariv\u0101ra</span></h2>\n<p>Of Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya\u2019s six sons, only two married and had their family successions, which turned into disciplic successions \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Mi\u015bra and Balar\u0101ma Mi\u015bra. The famous Vijaya K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Gosw\u0101m\u012b descends from Balar\u0101ma Mi\u015bra and the most famous d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-descendant of Balar\u0101ma Mi\u015bra is siddha Manohara D\u0101s B\u0101b\u0101ji of Govinda Ku\u1e47\u1e0da, Govardhan. The famous rasika scholar and lecturer \u015ar\u012bla \u0100nanda Gop\u0101l Gosw\u0101m\u012b appeared in the family tree of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Mi\u015bra Gosw\u0101m\u012b.

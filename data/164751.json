She is the mother of Mixcoatl and is particularly associated with the moth <i>Rothschildia orizaba</i> from the family Saturniidae. Some of her associations are birds and fire. Her nagual was a deer.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Iconography\">Iconography</span></h2>\n<p>Itzpapalotl's name can either mean \"obsidian butterfly\" or \"clawed butterfly\"; the latter meaning seems most likely. It's quite possible that clawed butterfly refers to the bat and in some instances Itzpapalotl is depicted with bat wings. However, she can also appear with clear butterfly or eagle attributes. Her wings are obsidian or tecpatl (flint) knife tipped. (In the <i>Manuscript of 1558</i>, Itzpapalotl is described as having \"blossomed into the white flint, and they took the white and wrapped it in a bundle.\") She could appear in the form of a beautiful, seductive woman or terrible goddess with a skeletal head and butterfly wings supplied with stone blades. Although the identity remains inconclusive, the Zapotec deity named Goddess 2J by Alfonso Caso and Ignacio Bernal may be a Classic Zapotec form of Itzpapalotl. In many instances Goddess 2J, whose image is found on ceramic urns, is identified with bats. \"In folklore, bats are sometimes called \"black butterflies\"\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ritual\">Ritual</span></h2>\n<p>Itzpapalotl is the patron of the day and associated with the stars Cozcuauhtli and Trecena 1 House in the Aztec calendar. The Trecena 1 House is one of the five western trecena dates dedicated to the cihuateteo, or women who had died in childbirth. Not only was Itzpapalotl considered one of the cihuateteo herself, but she was also one of the tzitzimime, star demons that threatened to devour people during solar eclipses.</p>\n<p>As the legend goes, Itzpapalotl fell from heaven along with Tzitzimime and several other shapes such as scorpions and toads. Itzpapalotl wore an invisible cloak so that no one could see her. At some times, she was said to have dressed up like a lady of the Mexican Court, caking her face with white powder and lining her cheeks with strips of rubber. Her fingers tapered into the claws of a jaguar, and her toes into eagle's claws.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mythology\">Mythology</span></h2>\n<p>According to the <i>Manuscript of 1558</i>, section VII, Itzpapalotl was one of two divine 2-headed doe-deers (the other one being Chimalman) who temporarily transformed themselves into women in order to seduce men. Itzpapalotl approached the two \"cloud serpents named Xiuhnel <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[\u02c8\u0283iwnel]</span> and Mimich <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[\u02c8mimit\u0361\u0283]</span>\", who transformed themselves into men (so as to disguise themselves when all the others of the Centzonmimixcoa had been slain in the ambush?). To Xiuhnel, Itzpapalotl said \"\"Drink, Xiuhnel.\" Xiuhnel drank the blood and then immediately lay down with her. Suddenly she ... devoured him, tore open his breast. ... Then Mimich ... ran and ... descended into a thorny barrel cactus, fell into it, and the woman fell down after him.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Influence_on_modern_culture\">Influence on modern culture</span></h2>\n<p>Orizaba the Moth Fairy, a villain in <i>Elena of Avalor</i>, was inspired by Itzpapalotl.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Aztec mythology in popular culture</li>\n<li>Black Sun (mythology)</li>\n<li>Cihuateteo</li>\n<li>Cihuacoatl</li>\n<li>Tzitzimime</li>\n<li>Mixcoatl</li>\n<li>Tamoanchan</li>\n<li>Huitzilopochtli</li>\n<li>Tlahuizcalpanteuctli</li>\n<li>Woman warrior</li>\n<li>List of women warriors in folklore</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>An image of <i>Rothschildia orizaba</i></li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aztec serpent sculpture.JPG"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Itzpapalotl 1.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Quetzalcoatl.svg"}]}

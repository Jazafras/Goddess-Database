Bunzi appears as a multicolored serpent, and rewards those who worship her with an abundant harvest. Mboze took her own son, Makanga, as a lover and gave birth to Bunzi. Upon seeing that Mboze had given birth to a serpent, Mboze's husband Kuitikuiti knew that she had been unfaithful to him, and killed her. Bunzi took on her mother's rain-bringing power. According to legend, when a rainbow appears in the sky, that is Bunzi. Sometimes she can also be seen in the rippling water of the river at sunset.</p>\n<p>The Bunzi Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named after her.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Mami Wata</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Chiwara male drawing.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Rainbow At Maraetai Beach New Zealand.jpg"}]}

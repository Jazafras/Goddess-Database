In a tale from the Metrical Dindshenchas, she is a good sorceress who joins three other of the Tuatha D\u00e9 to defeat the evil Greek witch Carman. According to the Book of Leinster (1150) B\u00e9 Chuille was killed, along with Dianann, by \"gray demons of air.\"</p>\n<p>Becuille is often confused with <b>Bechuma of the Fair Skin</b>. In <i>Echtrae Airt meic Cuinn</i> (<i>The Echtra, or Adventure, of Art mac Cuinn</i>), Bechuma is the wife of Eogan Inbir, but commits adultery with Gaidiar, son of Manann\u00e1n mac Lir, and is banished to the human world. Conn of the Hundred Battles marries her, but she becomes infatuated with his son Art. The druids inform Conn that Bechuma's wickedness has turned his realm into a Wasteland, and she is eventually exiled.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Gwynn, Edward (Ed) (1906). <i>The Metrical Dindshenchas</i> volume 3.

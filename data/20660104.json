She appeared as a force of nature. In ancient Turkic mythology there was a theory that mortals were the product of the union of Tengri and Yer (Earth). In the Orkhon Stone it says: \u201cIn the beginning there was a blue sky above, a dark land below, and human sons in-between.\" (<i>\u00dcze k\u00f6k tengri asra yagiz yir kilindukda ikin ara ki\u015fi o\u011fl\u0131 k\u0131l\u0131nm\u0131\u015f.</i>) The Turkic people revered the Earth Goddess (Yer Ana) as a giver of crops and abundance. In the Spring, before the beginning of the agricultural season and in the Autumn, after the harvest, as a sign of gratitude for the abundance of food and happiness, the ancient Turkish community and Mongols made a sacrifice to the Earth Goddess. Milk, kumys and tea were offered, and pleas were made for a fertile land and a rich yield.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ol><li>T\u00fcrk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik S\u00f6zl\u00fck, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yay\u0131nevi (Pages 612 - 613)</li>\n</ol><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Etugen Eke</li>\n<li>Otukan</li>\n</ul>"}

Aglaea is one of three daughters of Zeus and either the Oceanid Eurynome, or of Eunomia, the goddess of good order and lawful conduct. Her two sisters are Euphrosyne, the goddess of joy or mirth, and Thalia, the goddess of festivity and rich banquets. Together they are known as the Three Graces, or the Charites, and as such they attended Aphrodite, the goddess of love, with Aglaea sometimes acting as her messenger.</p>\n<p>Aglaea was also known as Charis (the Grace) and Cale (Beauty). Aglaea was married to Hephaestus after his divorce from Aphrodite, and by him became mother of Eucleia (\"Good Repute\"), Eupheme (\"Acclaim\"), Euthenia (\"Prosperity\"), and Philophrosyne (\"Welcome\").</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<p><b>Notes</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Sources</b></p>\n<ul><li>Grimal, Pierre, <i>The Dictionary of Classical Mythology</i>, Wiley-Blackwell, 1996, ISBN\u00a0978-0-631-20102-1. \"Charites\" p. 99</li>\n<li>Smith, William; <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</i>, London (1873). \"Charis\"</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Birth of Venus detail.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Canova-Three Graces 0 degree view.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg"}]}

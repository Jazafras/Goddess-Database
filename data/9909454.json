In Padma Purana, the cosmology includes her where the samudra manthan creates both good and bad of everything that emerges. That which is inauspicious and bad emerges first, more effort creates the auspicious and good, according to Padma Purana. First Alakshmi emerges, then Lakshmi appears during the Samudra manthan. Gods send Alakshmi to go dwell amongst pernicious persons, give them poverty and grief. She as the asuri of inauspiciousness and grief is the opposite of Lakshmi the goddess of auspiciousness and joy. Alakshmi is also known as Kalahapriya and Daridara, and the elder sisterly opposite of Lakshmi.</p>\n<p>According to Chakrabarty, \u201cIt was said that when she entered a household, Alakshmi brought jealousy and malice in her trail.

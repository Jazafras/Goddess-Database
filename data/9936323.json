{"pageid": 9936323, "ns": 0, "title": "\u0160au\u0161ka", "extract": "<p><b>\u0160au\u0161ka</b> or <b>Shaushka</b> (Hittite: <i>\u0160au\u0161a</i>, &amp; later <i>\u0160awu\u0161ka</i>) was a Hurrian goddess who was also adopted into the Hittite pantheon. She is known in detail because she became the patron goddess of the Hittite king Hattusili III (1420\u20131400 BC) following his marriage to Puduhepa, the daughter of the goddess' high priest. Her cultic center was Lawazantiya in Kizzuwatna.</p>\n<p>Shaushka is a goddess of fertility, war and healing. She is depicted in human form with wings, standing with a lion and accompanied by two attendants. She was considered equivalent to the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar and is sometimes identified using Ishtar's name in Hittite cuneiform.</p>\n<p>Shaushka is interesting in that she uses her authority in matters of sexuality to mess around a little where she saw fit. Texts describe Shaushka as similar to Ishtar, as an ambiguous goddess who supervised conjugal love and harmonious relationships but, unpredictably, could turn love into a dangerous endeavor. Reliefs at Yazilikaya show the goddess twice: in one relief she is depicted with male gods and in another with the goddesses. According to Hittite texts about Shaushka of Lawazantiya: she is clothed like a man and like a woman, and has male attributes such as an axe and weapons. Sometimes this has been taken as a sign of her bisexual or androgynous character.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id='Amarna_letters_\"\u0160au\u0161ka\"'></span><span id=\"Amarna_letters_.22.C5.A0au.C5.A1ka.22\">Amarna letters <i>\"\u0160au\u0161ka\"</i></span></h2>\n<p>In the 1350-1335 BC Amarna letters correspondence, (written mostly to the Ancient Egyptian pharaoh), one letter EA 23, (EA for 'el Amarna'), written to the pharaoh, has as its topic, the <i>Loaning of a Statue</i> to Egypt.

She also takes the form of a red serpent.</p>\n<p>Chantico is the goddess of precious things and is very defensive of her possessions. There are many Aztec legends as to what she does to people (or other gods) who take her things.</p>\n<p>Red is the dominant color of both Chantico\u2019s clothes and her face. Red lines appears on her yellow face, red paint covers her mouth, and a red shirt and headdress make up the chief elements of her attire. Chantico\u2019s headdress displays military attributes: a crown of poisonous cactus spikes, related to danger and aggression; a crest of <i>aztaxelli</i>, green warrior\u2019s feathers, connecting her with warfare. At the nape of her neck is a band that forms the <i>alt-tlachinolli</i>, or water-fire, a symbol for warfare and pestilence. From her head flows a stream of blue water intertwined with red fire. Chantico possesses both masculine and feminine qualities. She wears a man\u2019s loincloth, bordered with eagle feathers, in addition to a female\u2019s skirt, which is black and decorated with bundles of white down feathers. Her earrings are fashioned from circular, trapezoidal, and triangular forms. Chantico also wears a skull back-buckle. According to the <i>Codex Vaticanus A</i>, Tonacatecuhtli turned her into a dog when she broke fast during a religious celebration by eating roasted fish and paprika. She is seen with the teeth of a dog. In some manuscripts, she wears a turquoise nose ornament.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chantico</li>\n<li>Kroger, J., and Patrizia Granziera. <i>Aztec Goddesses and Christian Madonnas: Images of Divine Feminine in Mexico</i>.

{"pageid": 26496991, "ns": 0, "title": "Sequana", "extract": "<p>In Gallo-Roman religion, <b>Sequana</b> was the goddess of the river Seine, particularly the springs at the source of the Seine, and the Gaulish tribe the Sequani. The springs, called the <i>Fontes Sequanae</i> (\"The Springs of Sequana\") are located in a valley in the Ch\u00e2tillon Plateau, to the north-west of Dijon in Burgundy, and it was here, in the 2nd or 1st century BC, that a healing shrine was established. The sanctuary was later taken over by the Romans, who built two temples, a colonnaded precinct and other related structures centred on the spring and pool. Many dedications were made to Sequana at her temple, including a large pot inscribed with her name and filled with bronze and silver models of parts of human bodies to be cured by her. Wooden and stone images of limbs, internal organs, heads, and complete bodies were offered to her in the hope of a cure, as well as numerous coins and items of jewellery. Respiratory illnesses and eye diseases were common. Pilgrims were frequently depicted as carrying offerings to the goddess, including money, fruit, or a favorite pet dog or bird.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Representations\">Representations</span></h2>\n\n<p>A bronze statue of a woman, draped in a long gown and with a diadem on her head, is believed to represent Sequana (Deyts p.\u00a074). She stands on a boat, the prow of which is shaped like the head of a duck with a ball in its mouth, representing the playful, sometimes rebellious, nature of the [quacky] familiars under her command. The approximately 1 foot (30\u00a0cm) tall statue is now in the Mus\u00e9e arch\u00e9ologique de Dijon.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Inscriptions\">Inscriptions</span></h2>\n<p>Eight inscriptions to Sequana are known, all from the Sources of the Seine.

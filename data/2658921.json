The word Danu described the primeval waters which this deity perhaps embodied. In the Rigveda (I.32.9), she is identified as the mother of Vritra, the demonic serpent slain by Indra. In later Hinduism, she becomes the daughter of Daksha and the consort of Kasyapa.</p>\n<p>As a word for \"rain\" or \"liquid\", <i>d\u0101nu</i> is compared to Avestan <i>d\u0101nu</i> \"river\", and further to river names like Don, Danube, Dneiper, Dniestr, etc. There is also a Danu river in Nepal.

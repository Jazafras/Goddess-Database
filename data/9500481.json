{"pageid": 9500481, "ns": 0, "title": "Wosret", "extract": "<p><b>Wosret</b>, <b>Wasret</b>, or <b>Wosyet</b> meaning <i>the powerful</i> was an Egyptian goddess with a cult centre at Thebes in Upper Egypt. She was initially a localised guardian deity, whose cult rose widely to prominence during the stable twelfth dynasty when three pharaohs were named as her sons; for example, Senwosret (also spelled as Senusret), the man (son) of Wosret.</p>\n<p>She was rarely depicted, and no temples to her have been identified. One example of a depiction of Wosret is on the stela shown to the right where she is the figure farthest to the right.</p>\n<p>When she was depicted, it was wearing a tall crown with the Was sceptre, which was related to her name, upon her head and carrying other weapons such as spears as well as a bow and arrows.</p>\n<p>Wosret was later superseded by Mut and became an aspect of Hathor. She was also identified with the protection of the deity Horus, Isis' son, when he was young.</p>\n<p>She was Amun's first wife (John Ray calls her \"the theological equivalent of the girl next door\"), and was replaced by Mut, although it is possible that Mut is simply a later name for Wosret. On the stela above Amun is depicted to the left.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Footnotes\">Footnotes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Amunet</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aker.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ancient Egypt Wings.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Djed.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Dual stela of Hatsheput and Thutmose III (Vatican).jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Kheper.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Pyramidi aavikolla.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Symbol book class2.svg"}]}

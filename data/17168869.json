{"pageid": 17168869, "ns": 0, "title": "M\u00f3r Muman", "extract": "<p><b>M\u00f3r Muman</b> or <b>M\u00f3r Mumain</b> (modern spelling: <b>M\u00f3r Mhumhan</b>) is a figure from early Irish literature who is said to have been a queen of Munster and daughter of king \u00c1ed Benn\u00e1n. Her name means \"the Great Mother\" and the province of Munster (<i>An Mhumhain</i>) is named after her. She is believed to be an euhemerised mother goddess and sovereignty goddess of the province, particularly of the E\u00f3ganachta. M\u00f3r Muman \"personifies the land of Munster\" and \"the sovereignty of the region\". She is also known as Mugain and may be the same figure as Anu and the Morr\u00edgan.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Traditions\">Traditions</span></h2>\n<p>The Irish language tale <i>M\u00f3r Muman 7 Aided Cuanach meic Ailchine</i> (\"M\u00f3r Muman and the death of Cuanu mac Ailchine\") is found in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>. It is suggested that it dates from the 10th century or earlier. According to this tale, M\u00f3r was placed under an enchantment and went mad. She wandered Ireland for two years before she came to Cashel and the court of King F\u00edngen mac \u00c1edo Duib. Fingen eventually slept with her, and her memory returned. In the morning, Fingen gave her the queen's robe and brooch, and put aside his current queen, daughter of the king of the Deisi, and put M\u00f3r in her place as she was of better blood. The <i>Metrical Dindshenchas</i> say of Fingen and M\u00f3r:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Best of the women of Inis Fail<br>\nis M\u00f3r daughter of \u00c1ed Bennan.<br>\nBetter is Fingen than any hero<br>\nthat drives about Femen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When Fingen died, the story says, M\u00f3r Muman married Cathal mac Finguine. Unfortunately, the collector of this tale mistook this Cathal for his grandfather, Cathal mac \u00c1edo.</p>\n<p>A similar tale is told of Mis, who gave her name to the Slieve Mish Mountains and who may be the same figure as M\u00f3r. Mis is said to have went mad and to have lived as a wild woman in the mountains. She recovers after befriending and sleeping with a harper named Dubh Rois. These tales may be based on the common motif of the loathly lady, whereby the goddess of sovereignty appears as a hag until kissed by the rightful king, whereupon she becomes a beautiful young woman.</p>\n<p>In another tale, M\u00f3r and her husband Lear land in Ireland at the Dingle Peninsula and make their home at Dunmore Head (<i>D\u00fan M\u00f3r</i>, possibly meaning \"M\u00f3r's hillfort\"). One day, M\u00f3r climbs to the top of Mount Eagle to see the land in which she dwells. However, she is 'taken short' and squats to relieve herself. The ravines that cut through the mountains of Munster are said to have resulted from M\u00f3r's great streams of urine. This motif of a goddess creating the landscape is found in many ancient tales. At the foot of the mountain is a place called Tivoria or <i>Tigh Mh\u00f3ire</i> (\"M\u00f3r's house\").</p>\n<p>As a divinity, M\u00f3r Muman is believed to be identical with Mugain, and to include features of Medb and the Morrigan. She is sometimes referred to simply as Mumain, making her association with the land of Munster (Irish, <i>Mumu</i>) explicit.</p>\n<p>The death of M\u00f3r Muman ingen \u00c1edo Benn\u00e1in is recorded by the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> under the year 632 and by the <i>Annals of Tigernach</i> for 636.</p>\n<p>M\u00f3r's sister, Ruithchern, is also thought to represent the sovereignty goddess. She was the protagonist of the lost story <i>Aithed Ruithcherne la Cuanu mac Cailchin</i> (The killing of Ruithchern by Cuanu mac Ailchine).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>M\u00f3r Muman (Irish name)</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>"}

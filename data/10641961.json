Acting as a foster parent to Zeus' daughter Athena, Triton raised her alongside Pallas. During a friendly mock fight between the two, Zeus looked down from his seat in the sky and thought that they were fighting to kill. He distracted to Pallas with his ageis and, Athena, expecting Pallas to dodge, thrust a spear into her heart, killing Pallas instantly.</p>\n<p>Out of sadness and regret, she created the palladium, a statue in the likeness of Pallas. This story inspired a yearly festival in Libya dedicated to Athena. Girls from the Machlyans and Auseans tribes would fight each other, and those who died were labeled fake virgins.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Pallas from the Theoi Project</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Altes Museum - Antikensammlung 058.JPG"}]}

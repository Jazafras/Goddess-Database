{"pageid": 36293248, "ns": 0, "title": "Cel (goddess)", "extract": "<p><b>Cel</b> was the Etruscan goddess of the earth. On the Etruscan calendar, the month of <i>Celi</i> (September) is likely named for her. Her Greek counterpart is Gaia and her Roman is Tellus.</p>\n<p>In Etruscan mythology, Cel was the mother of the Giants. A bronze mirror from the 5th century BC depicts a theomachy in which <b>Celsclan</b>, \"son of Cel,\" is a Giant attacked by Laran, the god of war. In Greek, \"giant\" comes from a word meaning \"born from Gaia.\" Another mirror depicts anguiped Giants in the company of a goddess, possibly Cel, whose lower body is formed of vegetation.</p>\n<p>In a sanctuary near Lake Trasimeno were found five votive bronze statuettes, some male and some female, dedicated to her as <i>Cel Ati</i>, \"Mother Cel.\" The inscription on each reads <i>mi cel\u015b atial celthi,</i> \"I [belong to, have been given] to Cel the mother, here [in this sanctuary].\"</p>\n<p>Cel appears on the Liver of Piacenza, a bronze model of a liver marked for the Etruscan practice of haruspicy. She is placed in House 13.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

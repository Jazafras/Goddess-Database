In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her.

But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism.

The name Kali comes from <i>k\u0101la</i>, which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for Shiva. Kali means \"the black one\". Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In K\u0101li's most famous myth, Durga and her assistants, the Matrikas, wound the demon Raktabija, in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him. They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilt from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself. The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates. Durga, in need of help, summons K\u0101li to combat the demons. It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess K\u0101li at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as <i>Daksinakali</i>.</li>\n<li>Other warrior goddesses include Chamunda (\"the killer of demon Chanda and Munda\") and the goddess group Matrikas (\"Mothers\").</li>\n<li>Vishpala (in <i>The Rigveda</i>) is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>List of female action heroes</li>\n<li>Woman warrior</li>\n<li>Timeline of women in early modern warfare</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Amazon preparing for the battle (Queen Antiope or Armed Venus) - Pierre-Eugene-Emile Hebert 1860 - NG of Arts Wash DC rotated and cropped.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Blenda uppmanar - August Malmstr\u00f6m 1860.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Boudiccastatue.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:GD-EG-KomOmbo016.JPG"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Hangaku Gozen by Yoshitoshi.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Itzpapalotl 1.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Jeanne Hachette Dubray 2007 06 17.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Queen suriyothai0609.jpg"}]}

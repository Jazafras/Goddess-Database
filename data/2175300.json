She is attested in a single inscription, <i>RIB</i> 2107, on an altar stone found at Birrens (the Roman Blatobulgium) in what is now Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. According to the inscription, the altar was raised by men from Vella serving with the Second Cohort of Tungrians in fulfillment of a vow to the goddess. Xavier Delamarre has suggested that her name may be related to the Gaulish word *<i>ric\u0101</i>, meaning <i>\u2018sillon\u2019</i> (\u2018furrow\u2019).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Rouelle d or Balesme Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Triskele-Symbol-spiral.svg"}]}

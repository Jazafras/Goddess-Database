She is a part of the trinity (<i>Tridevi</i>) of Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati. All the three forms help the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to create, maintain and regenerate-recycle the Universe respectively.</p>\n<p>The earliest known mention of Saraswati as a goddess is in the Rigveda. She has remained significant as a goddess from the Vedic period through modern times of Hindu traditions. Some Hindus celebrate the festival of Vasant Panchami (the fifth day of spring) in her honour, and mark the day by helping young children learn how to write alphabets on that day. The Goddess is also revered by believers of the Jain religion of west and central India, as well as some Buddhist sects.</p>\n<p>Saraswati is also worshiped outside the Indian subcontinent, in nations such as Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Myanmar.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>Saraswati, sometimes spelled Sarasvati, is a Sanskrit fusion word of <i>s\u0101ra</i> (\u0938\u093e\u0930) which means \"essence\", and <i>sva</i> (\u0938\u094d\u0935) which means \"one self\", the fused word meaning \"essence of one self\" and Saraswati meaning \"one who leads to essence of self-knowledge\". It is also a Sanskrit composite word of <i>surasa-vati</i> (\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0938-\u0935\u0924\u093f) which means \"one with plenty of water\".</p>\n<p>The word Saraswati appears both as a reference to a river and as a significant deity in the Rigveda. In initial passages, the word refers to the Sarasvati River and is mentioned as one among several northwestern Indian rivers such as the Drishadvati. Saraswati, then, connotes a river deity. In Book 2, the Rigveda describes Saraswati as the best of mothers, of rivers, of goddesses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u0905\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0928\u0926\u0940\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u093f\u0924\u092e\u0947 <b>\u0938\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u093f</b> |<br>\n\u2013 Rigveda 2.41.16</p>\n<p>Best Mother, best of Rivers, best of Goddesses, Sarasvat\u012b, We are, as \u2019twere, of no repute and dear Mother, give thou us renown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saraswati is celebrated as a feminine deity with healing and purifying powers of abundant, flowing waters in Book 10 of the Rigveda, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u0905\u092a\u094b \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u093e\u0924\u0930\u0903 \u0936\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0927\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0918\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0947\u0928 \u0928\u094b \u0918\u0930\u094d\u0924\u092a\u094d\u0935\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941 |<br>\n\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0939\u093f \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u0935\u0939\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0926\u0947\u0935\u093f\u0930\u0941\u0926\u093f\u0926\u093e\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0903 \u0936\u0941\u091a\u093f\u0930\u093e\u092a\u0942\u0924 \u090f\u092e\u093f ||<br>\n\u2013 Rigveda 10.17</p>\n<p>May the waters, the mothers, cleanse us,<br>\nmay they who purify with butter, purify us with butter,<br>\nfor these goddesses bear away defilement,<br>\nI come up out of them pure and cleansed.<br>\n\u2013Translated by John Muir</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Vedic literature, Saraswati acquires the same significance for early Indians (states John Muir) as that accredited to the river Ganges by their modern descendants. In hymns of Book 10 of Rigveda, she is already declared to be the \"possessor of knowledge\". Her importance grows in Vedas composed after Rigveda and in Brahmanas, and the word evolves in its meaning from \"waters that purify\", to \"that which purifies\", to \"<i>vach</i> (speech) that purifies\", to \"knowledge that purifies\", and ultimately into a spiritual concept of a goddess that embodies knowledge, arts, music, melody, muse, language, rhetoric, eloquence, creative work and anything whose flow purifies the essence and self of a person. In Upanishads and Dharma Sastras, Saraswati is invoked to remind the reader to meditate on virtue, virtuous emoluments, the meaning and the very essence of one's activity, one's action. Some may wonder as to what would be the relation of Saraswati and Lord Vishnu. She is a very close relative of Thirumal.</p>\n<p>Saraswati is known by many names in ancient Hindu literature. Some examples of synonyms for Saraswati include Brahmani (power of Brahma), Brahmi (goddess of sciences), Bharadi (goddess of history), Vani and Vachi (both referring to the flow of music/song, melodious speech, eloquent speaking respectively), Varnesvari (goddess of letters), Kavijihvagravasini (one who dwells on the tongue of poets).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Nomenclature\">Nomenclature</span></h3>\n<p>In the Nepali language, her name is written Nepali: <span lang=\"ne\" xml:lang=\"ne\">\u0938\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0940</span>. In the Telugu, Sarasvati is also known as Chaduvula Thalli (\u0c1a\u0c26\u0c41\u0c35\u0c41\u0c32 \u0c24\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f) and Sh\u0101rada (\u0c36\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c26). In Konkani, she is referred to as Sh\u0101rada, Veenapani, Pustaka dharini, Vidyad\u0101yini. In Kannada, variants of her name include Sharade, Sharadamba, V\u0101ni, Veenapani in the famous Sringeri temple. In Tamil, she is also known as Kalaimagal (\u0b95\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0bae\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd), Kalaiv\u0101ni (\u0b95\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bbf), V\u0101ni (\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bbf) and Bharathi.

In Hindu tradition, she has retained her significance as a goddess from the Vedic age up to the present day. In Shanti Parva of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Saraswati is called the mother of the Vedas, and later as the celestial creative symphony who appeared when Brahma created the universe. In Book 2 of Taittiriya Brahmana, she is called the mother of eloquent speech and melodious music. Saraswati is the active energy and power of Brahma. She is also mentioned in many minor Sanskrit publications such as Sarada Tilaka of 8th century AD as follows,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May the goddess of speech enable us to attain all possible eloquence,<br>\nshe who wears on her locks a young moon,<br>\nwho shines with exquisite lustre,<br>\nwho sits reclined on a white lotus,<br>\nand from the crimson cusp of whose hands pours,<br>\nradiance on the implements of writing, and books produced by her favour.<br>\n\u2013 On Saraswati, Sarada Tilaka</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saraswati became a prominent deity in Buddhist iconography \u2013 the consort of Manjushri in 1st millennium AD. In some instances such as in the <i>Sadhanamala</i> of Buddhist pantheon, she has been symbolically represented similar to regional Hindu iconography, but unlike the more well known depictions of Saraswati.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Symbolism_and_iconography\">Symbolism and iconography</span></h2>\n\n<p>The goddess Saraswati is often depicted as a beautiful woman dressed in pure white, often seated on a white lotus, which symbolizes light, knowledge and truth. She not only embodies knowledge but also the experience of the highest reality. Her iconography is typically in white themes from dress to flowers to swan \u2013 the colour symbolizing Sattwa Guna or purity, discrimination for true knowledge, insight and wisdom.</p>\n<p>Her dhyana mantra describes her to be as white as the moon, clad in a white dress, bedecked in white ornaments, radiating with beauty, holding a book &amp; a pen in her hands. The book &amp; the pen represent knowledge</p>\n<p>She is generally shown to have four arms, but sometimes just two. When shown with four hands, those hands symbolically mirror her husband Brahma's four heads, representing <i>manas</i> (mind, sense), <i>buddhi</i> (intellect, reasoning), <i>citta</i> (imagination, creativity) and <i>ahamk\u0101ra</i> (self consciousness, ego). Brahma represents the abstract, she action and reality.</p>\n<p>The four hands hold items with symbolic meaning \u2014 a <i>pustaka</i> (book or script), a <i>m\u0101l\u0101</i> (rosary, garland), a water pot and a musical instrument (v\u012bn\u0101). The book she holds symbolizes the Vedas representing the universal, divine, eternal, and true knowledge as well as all forms of learning. A m\u0101l\u0101 of crystals, representing the power of meditation, inner reflection and spirituality. A pot of water represents the purifying power to separate right from wrong, the clean from the unclean, and essence from the inessential. In some texts, the pot of water is symbolism for soma - the drink that liberates and leads to knowledge. The most famous feature on Saraswati is a musical instrument called a veena, represents all creative arts and sciences, and her holding it symbolizes expressing knowledge that creates harmony. Saraswati is also associated with <i>anur\u0101ga</i>, the love for and rhythm of music, which represents all emotions and feelings expressed in speech or music.</p>\n<p>A hamsa or swan is often located next to her feet. In Hindu mythology, the hamsa is a sacred bird, which if offered a mixture of milk and water, is said to be able to drink the milk alone. It thus symbolizes the ability to discriminate between good and evil, essence from outward show and the eternal from the evanescent. Due to her association with the swan, Saraswati is also referred to as Hamsav\u0101hini, which means \"she who has a hamsa as her vehicle\". The swan is also a symbolism for spiritual perfection, transcendence and moksha.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a <i>citramekhala</i> (also called <i>mayura</i>, peacock) is shown beside the goddess. The peacock symbolizes colorful splendor, celebration of dance, and - as the devourer of snakes - the alchemical ability to transmute the serpent poison of self into the radiant plumage of enlightenment.</p>\n<p>She is usually depicted near a flowing river or other body of water, which depiction may constitute a reference to her early history as a river goddess.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Regional_manifestations_of_Saraswati\">Regional manifestations of Saraswati</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Maha_Saraswati\">Maha Saraswati</span></h3>\n<p>In some regions of India, such as Vindhya, Odisha, West Bengal and Assam, as well as east Nepal, Saraswati is part of the Devi Mahatmya mythology, in the trinity (<i>Tridevi</i>) of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati. This is one of many different Hindu legends that attempt to explain how Hindu trinity of gods (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) and goddesses (Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati) came into being. Various Purana texts offer alternate legends for Maha Saraswati.</p>\n<p>Maha Saraswati is depicted as eight-armed and is often portrayed holding a Veena whilst sitting on a white lotus flower.</p>\n<p>Her dhy\u0101na shloka given at the beginning of the fifth chapter of Devi Mahatmya is:</p>\n<dl><dd>Wielding in her lotus-hands the bell, trident, ploughshare, conch, pestle, discus, bow, and arrow, her lustre is like that of a moon shining in the autumn sky. She is born from the body of Gowri and is the sustaining base of the three worlds. That Mahasaraswati I worship here who destroyed Sumbha and other asuras.</dd>\n</dl><p>Maha<b>saraswati</b> is also part of another legend, the <i>Navdurgas</i>, or nine forms of Durga, revered as powerful and dangerous goddesses in eastern India. They have special significance on <i>Navaratri</i> in these regions.

Nila Saraswati is a different deity from traditional Saraswati, yet subsumes her knowledge and creative energy in tantric literature. Nila Sarasvati is the <i>ugra</i> (angry, violent, destructive) manifestation in one school of Hinduism, while the more common Saraswati is the <i>saumya</i> (calm, compassionate, productive) manifestation found in most others. In tantric literature of the former, Nilasaraswati has a 100 names.

The celebrations start with the Puja Vypu (Placing for Worship). It consists of placing the books for puja on the Ashtami day. It may be in one's own house, in the local nursery school run by traditional teachers, or in the local temple. The books will be taken out for reading, after worship, only on the morning of the third day (Vijaya Dashami). It is called Puja Eduppu (Taking [from] Puja). Children are happy, since they are not expected to study on these days. On the Vijaya Dashami day, Kerala celebrates the Ezhuthiniruthu or Initiation of Writing for the little children before they are admitted to nursery schools. This is also called Vidyarambham. The child is made to write for the first time on the rice spread in a plate with the index finger, guided by an elder of the family or by a teacher.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Outside_the_Indian_subcontinent\">Outside the Indian subcontinent</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Myanmar\">Myanmar</span></h3>\n\n<p>In Burma, the Shwezigon Mon Inscription dated to be of 1084 AD, near Bagan, recites the name Saraswati as follows,</p>\n<dl><dd>\"The wisdom of eloquence called Saraswati shall dwell in mouth of King Sri Tribhuwanadityadhammaraja at all times\". \u2013 Translated by Than Tun</dd>\n</dl><p>In Buddhist arts of Myanmar, she is called <i>Thurathadi</i> (or Thay\u00e9thadi).

Also in India, the Kurkihar hoard contains seven bronze images of Paranasabari belonging to 10th- 12th century AD.</p>\n<p>Some researchers believe Paranasabari is another name for Hindu Goddess Devi Tara, and Tara is the only female goddess not only worshiped in India but also Mongolia and Tsarist Russia. Again in Buddhist religion incidentally, Paranasabari is depicted as attendant of Buddhist deity of same name, Tara. While some say that term Paranasabari is an attempt to connect the deity with Vindya region, as Sabaras had stronghold over the region.</p>\n<p>Paranasabari is also depicted in some images of Pala period found in Dacca, as main goddess and is escorted by Hindu deities Jvarasura and Shitala. Both of these escorts are again disease related Hindu deities. In some images these deities are shown as flying away to escape from wrath of Vajrayogini, the Buddhist Goddess and destroyer of diseases.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

She was portrayed as a beautiful lady with silver jewelry who patronized not only the location but also the foreigners who travelled in this area. With the advent of Christianity, this cult became closely associated with that of the Virgin Mary (Mother of God). They share some common features of rituals and <i>Adgilis Ghvtismshobeli</i> (\"Mother of God of the Place\") is still worshipped as a patroness of the community among the Georgian highlanders.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Adgilis Deda church in Kakheti, Georgia.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Draig.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Flag of Georgia.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:\u9f8d-seal.svg"}]}

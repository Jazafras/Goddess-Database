{"pageid": 9022019, "ns": 0, "title": "S\u00e1ga and S\u00f6kkvabekkr", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, <b>S\u00e1ga</b> (<small>Old Norse:\u00a0</small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[sa\u02d0\u0263a]</span>, possibly meaning \"seeress\") is a goddess associated with the wisdom <b>S\u00f6kkvabekkr</b> (<small>Old Norse:\u00a0</small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[s\u0254k\u02d0wabek\u02d0r]</span>; \"sunken bank\", \"sunken bench\", or \"treasure bank\"). At S\u00f6kkvabekkr, S\u00e1ga and the god Odin merrily drink as cool waves flow. Both S\u00e1ga and S\u00f6kkvabekkr are attested in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the <i>Prose Edda</i>, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess and her associated location, including that the location may be connected to the goddess Frigg's fen residence Fensalir and that S\u00e1ga may be another name for <i>Frigg</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The etymology of the name <i>S\u00e1ga</i> is generally held to be connected to the Old Norse verb <i>sj\u00e1</i>, meaning \"to see\" (from Proto-Germanic *<i>sehwan</i>). This may mean that S\u00e1ga is to be understood as a seeress. Since Frigg is referred to as a seeress in the poem <i>Lokasenna</i>, this etymology has led to theories connecting S\u00e1ga to Frigg. Rudolf Simek says that this etymology raises vowel problems and that a link to <i>saga</i> and <i>segja</i> (meaning \"say, tell\") is more likely, yet that this identification is also problematic.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n\n<p>In the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l</i>, S\u00f6kkvabekkr is presented fourth among a series of stanzas describing the residences of various gods. In the poem, Odin (disguised as <i>Gr\u00edmnir</i>) tells the young Agnar that Odin and S\u00e1ga happily drink there from golden cups while waves resound:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I</i>, the hero Sinfj\u00f6tli references S\u00e1ga in the name of a location found in a stanza where Sinfj\u00f6tli flyts with Gu\u00f0mundr. The location name, <i>nes S\u00e1gu</i>, has been variously translated as \"Saga's Headland,\" \"Saga's Cape,\" and \"Saga's ness\" Part of the stanza may be missing and, due to this, some editors have joined it with the stanza prior.</p>\n<p>S\u00e1ga is mentioned once in both the <i>Prose Edda</i> books <i>Gylfaginning</i> and <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, while Sokkvabekk is only mentioned once, in <i>Gylfaginning</i>. In chapter 35 of <i>Gylfaginning</i>, High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) about the \u00e1synjur. High follows a description of Frigg and her dwelling Fensalir with \"Second is Saga. She dwells in Sokkvabekk, and that is a big place.\" In chapter 75 of the book <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, S\u00e1ga is present among a list of 27 \u00e1synjur, but no information is provided about her there.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Theories\">Theories</span></h2>\n\n<p>John Lindow says that due to similarity between S\u00f6kkvabekkr and Fensalir, \"Odin's open drinking with S\u00e1ga\", and the potential etymological basis for S\u00e1ga being a seeress has \"led most scholars to understand S\u00e1ga as another name for Frigg.\" Stephan Grundy states that the words <i>S\u00e1ga</i> and <i>S\u00f6kkvabekkr</i> may be by-forms of <i>Frigg</i> and <i>Fensalir</i>, respectively, used for the purpose of composing alliterative verse.</p>\n<p>Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m theorizes that \"Frigg's role as a fertility goddess is revealed in the name of her abode, Fensalir [...]\", that Frigg is the same as S\u00e1ga, and that both the names <i>Fensalir</i> and <i>S\u00f6kkvabekkr</i> \"imply a goddes [<i>sic</i>] living in the water and recall the fertility goddess Nerthus\". N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m adds that \"S\u00f6kkvabekkr, the subterranean water, alludes to the well of Urd, hidden under the roots of Yggdrasil and the chthonic function, which is manifest in Freyja's character.\"</p>\n<p>Rudolf Simek says that S\u00e1ga should be considered \"one of the not closer defined Asyniur\" along with Hl\u00edn, Sj\u00f6fn, Snotra, V\u00e1r, and V\u00f6r, and that they \"should be seen as female protective goddesses.\" Simek adds that \"these goddesses were all responsible for specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.\"</p>\n<p>19th century scholar Jacob Grimm comments that \"the gods share their power and influence with goddesses, the heroes and priests with wise women.\" Grimm notes that S\u00f6kkvabekkr is \"described as a place where cool waters rush\" and that Odin and S\u00e1ga \"day to day drink gladly out of golden cups.\" Grimm theorizes that the liquid from these cups is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd>the drink of immortality, and at the same time of poesy. <i>Saga</i> may be taken as wife or as daughter of O\u00f0inn; in either case she is identical to him as god of poetry. With the Greeks the <i>Musa</i> was a daughter of Zeus, but often hear of three or nine Muses, who resemble our wise women, norns and sch\u00f6pferins (shapers of destiny), and dwell beside springs or wells. The cool flood well befits the swanwives, daughters of Wish. <i>Saga</i> can be no other than our sage (saw, tale), the 'm\u00e6re' [...] personified and deified.</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Commons-logo.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Odin and S\u00e1ga by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Odin und Saga.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Symbol support vote.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:S\u00e1ga and Odin by Robert Engels.jpg"}]}

{"pageid": 775009, "ns": 0, "title": "Ba\u2018alat Gebal", "extract": "<p><b>Ba\u2018alat Gebal</b>, 'Lady of Byblos', was the goddess of the city of Byblos, Phoenicia in ancient times. She was sometimes known to the Greeks as <b>Baaltis</b> or Atargatis.</p>\n<p>Ba\u2018alat Gebal was generally identified with the pan-Semitic goddess \u2018Ashtart (Astarte) and, like \u2018Ashtart, equated with the Greek goddess Aphrodite. However, Sanchuniathon presents Ba\u2018alat Gebal as a sister of \u2018Ashtart and Asherah, and calls Ba\u2018alat Gebal by the name <i>Dione</i>, meaning that he identified her either with Asherah or with the mother of Greek Aphrodite, the Titan goddess Dione. According to Sanchuniathon, Baaltis/Dione, like Asherah and \u2018Ashtart, was a sister and wife of 'El. He states that she bore daughters to El and that it was El who gave the city of Byblos to her.</p>\n<p>Ba\u2018alat Gebal was distinguished in iconography from \u2018Ashtart or other aspects of \u2018Ashtart or similar goddesses by two, tall, upright feathers in her headdress.</p>\n<p>The temple of Ba\u2018alat Gebal in Byblos was built around 2700 BC. Dedications from Egyptians begin appearing from the second to the 6th Egyptian dynasties. Two of these inscriptions equate Ba\u2018alat Gebal with the Egyptian goddess Hathor. Frank Moore Cross writes that at Sinai <i>Ba\u2018alat</i> seems to have referred to Hathor and possibly to Qud\u0161u (see Qetesh), who is Asherah.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Jean-Pierre Thiollet, <i>Je m'appelle Byblos</i> (My name is Byblos), H &amp; D, 2005.

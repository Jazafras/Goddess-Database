The Second Branch of the <i>Mabinogi</i> names Bran, Branwen, and Manawydan as her children by Ll\u0177r, and ascribes to her two additional sons by Euroswydd: Nisien, a good man, and Efnysien, a conniving troublemaker. The Welsh Triads call Ll\u0177r one of the Three Exalted Prisoners of Britain for his captivity at Euroswydd's hands; this likely refers to a lost tradition of the birth of Penarddun's younger sons. The <i>Mabinogi</i> names Penarddun as a daughter of the ancestor Beli Mawr, but the genealogy is confused; it is possible she was meant to be his sister rather than daughter.</p>\n<p>The name Penarddun can be translated as \"Chief Beauty\" or \"Most Fair\" (Welsh <i>pen</i> \"head, chief, foremost\" + <i>arddun</i> \"fair, beautiful (of a girl)\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

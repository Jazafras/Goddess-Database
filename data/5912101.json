Personal names incorporating the name Manaf such as \u2018Abd Manaf show that his cult was widespread among the tribes of Quraysh, Hudhayl, and Tamim. Although al-Tabari calls Manaf \"one of the greatest deities of Mecca,\" very little information is available on the subject. It is sometimes said that women, who normally touched his idol as a token of blessing, kept away from it during menstruation, but T. Fahd notes that this practice was common to all idols according to the available report from Ibn Al-Kalbi. Manaf's name is found in Thamudic, Safaitic, and Lihyanitic inscriptions, and there were altars dedicated to him at Hawran in the Levant and at Volubilis in Morocco.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Hubal</li>\n<li>Al-Lat</li>\n<li>Man\u0101t</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

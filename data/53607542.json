Upon their arrival in Mecca they entered the Ka'bah. Taking advantage of the absence of anyone else and of the privacy of the Sacred House, Isaf committed adultery with her in the sanctuary. Thereupon they were transformed into stone, becoming two <i>miskhs</i>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the traditions of the Meccan local historian al-Azraq\u012b (\u2020 837), the incident happened at the time when the Arab tribe of the Jurchh ruled over Mecca. The two stones were then removed from the Kaaba and placed on the Al-Safa and Al-Marwah hills, so that the people would be warned. Over the course of time, they were then venerated as idols.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"As_idols\">As idols</span></h2>\n<p>Some scholars, including al-Azraqi, claimed that 'Amr ibn Luhayy, the patriarch of the Arab tribe Chuz\u0101'a, who introduced idolatry in Mecca, was responsible for the worship of Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. He had called on people to worship them and justified the fact that their ancestors had already done so. The Quraishit Qusaiy ibn Kil\u0101b had then taken the two stones to the well of Zamzam near the Kaaba.</p>\n<p>After the Muslim capture of the city in January 630, the two stone idols were destroyed.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

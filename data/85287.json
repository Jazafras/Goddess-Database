{"pageid": 85287, "ns": 0, "title": "Empanda", "extract": "<p>In ancient Roman religion, <b>Empanda</b> or <b>Panda</b> was a goddess, or possibly an epithet of Juno.</p>\n<p>Festus identifies her only as a <i>dea paganorum</i>, \"goddess of the rustics.\" Varro connects the word with <i>pandere</i>, \"to open,\" but also explains it by <i>panem dare</i>, \"to give bread,\" so that Empanda would be the goddess of bread or food.</p>\n<p>She had a sanctuary near the gate which led to the capitol and which was called the <i>Porta Pandana</i> after her. Her temple was an asylum which was always open. Needy supplicants who came to it were supplied with food from the resources of the temple. In the opinion of Leonhard Schmitz, this custom shows the meaning of the name <i>Panda</i> or <i>Empanda</i>: it is connected with <i>pandere</i>, to open; she is accordingly the goddess who is open to or admits any one who wants protection. Hartung thinks that <i>Empanda</i> and <i>Panda</i> are only surnames of Juno.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Footnotes\">Footnotes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0<cite id=\"CITEREFLeonhard_Schmitz1870\" class=\"citation encyclopaedia\">Leonhard Schmitz (1870). \"<sup><span>article name needed</span></sup>\".

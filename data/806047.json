She is the antipode to Vakarin\u0117, the Evening Star.</p>\n<p>Her cult possibly stems from that of the Indo-European dawn goddess Hausos and is related to Latvian Auseklis, Greek Eos, Roman Aurora, and Vedic Ushas. Au\u0161rin\u0117 is the goddess of beauty and youth. After the Christianization of Lithuania, the cult merged with Christian images and the symbolism of the Virgin Mary.</p>\n<p>Au\u0161rin\u0117 was first mentioned by Jan \u0141asicki as <i>Ausca</i> and described as <i>goddess of the rays of the sun that descend and rise above the horizon</i>. According to folklore, each morning Au\u0161rin\u0117 and her servant Tarnaitis (possibly Mercury) prepare the way for Saul\u0117 (the Sun). In the evening, Vakarin\u0117 prepares the bed for Saul\u0117. The relationship between Saul\u0117 and Au\u0161rin\u0117 is complex. Sometimes Saul\u0117 is described as mother of Au\u0161rin\u0117, Vakarin\u0117 and other planets \u2013 Indraja (Jupiter), S\u0117lija (Saturn), \u017diezdr\u0117 (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury), and even \u017demyna (Earth). A popular myth describes how M\u0117nulis (Moon) fell in love with beautiful Au\u0161rin\u0117, cheated on his wife Saul\u0117, and received punishment from Perk\u016bnas (thunder god). Different myths also depict rivalry between Saul\u0117 and Au\u0161rin\u0117 as Saul\u0117 is jealous of Au\u0161rin\u0117's beauty and brightness (Venus is the third-brightest object in the sky after Sun and Moon). Despite the adultery or rivalry, Au\u0161rin\u0117 remains loyal and continues to serve Saul\u0117 in the mornings.</p>\n<p>Another myth, analyzed by Algirdas Julien Greimas in detail, tells a story of Joseph, who becomes fascinated with Au\u0161rin\u0117 appearing in the sky and goes on a quest to find the \"second sun.\" After much adventure, he learns that it was not the second sun, but a maiden, who lives on an island in the sea and has the same hair as the Sun. With advice from the Northern Wind, Joseph reaches the island, avoids a guardian bull, and becomes the maiden's servant caring for her cattle. In the tale, Au\u0161rin\u0117 appeared in three forms: as a star in the sky, as a maiden on land, and as a mare in the sea. After a few years, Joseph puts a single hair of the maiden into an empty nutshell and throws it into the sea. A ray from the sea becomes reflected into the sky as the biggest star. Greimas concludes that this tale is a double origin myth: the story describes the origin of Tarnaitis and the ascent of Au\u0161rin\u0117 herself into the sky.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Hausos in reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion</li>\n<li>Zorya in Slavic mythology</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

{"pageid": 2003774, "ns": 0, "title": "Sj\u00f6fn", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, <b>Sj\u00f6fn</b> (or <b>Sj\u01ebfn</b> in Old Norse orthography) is a goddess associated with love. Sj\u00f6fn is attested in the <i>Prose Edda</i>, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in three kennings employed in skaldic poetry. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n<p>In chapter 35 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Gylfaginning</i>, High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur. High lists Sj\u00f6fn seventh, and says that Sj\u00f6fn is \"concerned to direct people's minds to love, both women and men.\" In addition, High states that from Sj\u00f6fn's name comes the Old Norse word <i>sjafni</i>. In the Nafna\u00feulur section appended to the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, chapter 75, Sj\u00f6fn is included in a list of 27 names of \u00e1synjur. Otherwise, the name <i>Sj\u00f6fn</i> is thrice employed as a base word in skaldic kennings for \"woman\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Theories\">Theories</span></h2>\n<p>Regarding the information given about Sj\u00f6fn in <i>Gylfaginning</i>, John Lindow says that the word <i>sjafni</i> does indeed appear listed in the \u00feulur as a word for \"love\", yet that outside this description no information about the goddess is known. Lindow states that some scholars theorize that Sj\u00f6fn may be the goddess Frigg under another name. Rudolf Simek says that Snorri may have derived his etymology of <i>Sj\u00f6fn</i> from the Old Norse words <i>sefi</i> (\"sense\") or from <i>sefi</i> (possibly \"relation\"), but that the scant references to Sj\u00f6fn do not allow for much more of an elaborate explanation for the goddess. Simek says that, accordingly, Sj\u00f6fn is viewed as a goddess of \"marriage and love, or else one of relationships\" and that Sj\u00f6fn is among several goddesses mentioned in the <i>Prose Edda</i> \"who are matron-like guardian-goddesses.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Faulkes, Anthony (Trans.)

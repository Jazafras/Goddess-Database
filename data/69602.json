{"pageid": 69602, "ns": 0, "title": "Snotra", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, <b>Snotra</b> (Old Norse \"clever\") is a goddess associated with wisdom. Snotra is solely attested in the <i>Prose Edda</i>, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n<p>In chapter 35 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Gylfaginning</i>, High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur. High lists Snotra thirteenth, and says that Snotra \"is wise and courteous.\" In addition, High adds that, after Snotra's name, a wise man or woman can be called <i>snotr</i>. In the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, Snotra is included among a list of 27 \u00e1synjur names. Apart from these two sources, Snotra is otherwise unattested.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Theories\">Theories</span></h2>\n<p>Andy Orchard and Rudolf Simek state that, as Snotra is unattested beyond the <i>Prose Edda</i>, Snotra may be an invention of Snorri's. Orchard theorizes that, otherwise, Snorri may have had access to a lost source, and that the little information Snorri presents may be derived from the meaning of her name.</p>\n<p>Simek says that Snorri may have invented Snotra from the Old Norse word <i>snotr</i> (\"clever\") and \"placed [her] next to other insignificant goddesses.\" However, Simek also writes that the goddesses Snotra, S\u00e1ga, Hl\u00edn, Sj\u00f6fn, V\u00e1r, and V\u00f6r should be considered vaguely defined figures who \"should be seen as female protective goddesses\" that are all responsible for \"specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

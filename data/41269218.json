Eoicha gave birth to Cernunnos after eating the seeds off an oak tree. During the birth of Cernunnos, the pain of the labor was so intense that Eiocha ripped off the bark of the Oak, and threw it into the sea, creating the giants of the deep. Out of loneliness, Cernunnos coupled with Eoicha, creating Maponos, Tauranis, Teutates, and Epona. When her children became adults, she grew tired of the world, and returned to the sea, becoming Tethra, the Goddess of the Deep. Epona would later create horses in the memory of Eiocha.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ambox important.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Wiki letter w.svg"}]}

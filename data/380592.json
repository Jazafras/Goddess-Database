All of the variants of the name in the Slavic languages are pronounced in the same or almost exactly the same manner regardless of the language and alphabet.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<p>In his book <i>Deutsche Mythologie</i> (1835), Jacob Grimm noted that Russians used the word <i>kupala</i> to describe the bonfires they lit at the summer solstice, and recorded that some people explained the word as the name <i>Kupulo</i>, a harvest god. Although the word <i>kupala</i> (or <i>kupalo</i>) is usually explained as \"bather\" (from <i>kupat(i)</i> 'to bathe'), some scholars claim that it is not an epithet of John the Baptist, but a name of a pre-Christian Slavic deity, derived from some other root. According to Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov, the name <i>Kupala</i> is derived from the same Indo-European root as the name of Cupid, Roman god of love, which means 'passion' or 'desire'. The cult of Kupala, the god of fertility and sexuality, was presumably replaced by worship of John the Baptist.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Kupala Night</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}]}

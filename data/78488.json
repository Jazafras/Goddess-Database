Lampri\u00e8re's Classical Dictionary states \"According to the most received opinions, they were three in number, Tisiphone, \"Megaera ... daughter of Nox and Acheron\", and Alecto\".</p>\n<p>Megaera is the cause of jealousy and envy, and punishes people who commit crimes, especially marital infidelity. Like her sisters Alecto and Tisiphone, as well as the Melian Nymphs, she was born of the blood of Uranus when Cronus castrated him.</p>\n<p>In modern French (<i>m\u00e9g\u00e8re</i>), Portuguese (<i>megera</i>), Modern Greek (\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1), Italian (<i>megera</i>) and Russian (\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0430), this name denotes a jealous or spiteful woman - Google translates all five as \"shrew\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modern_reception\">Modern reception</span></h2>\n<p>Thorne Smith includes a character Megaera (mostly referred to as \"Meg\") in <i>The Night Life of the Gods</i> (1931).

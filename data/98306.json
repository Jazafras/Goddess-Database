They were closely associated with the concept of the <i>ka</i> (life force or spirit) and could be seen as the female personification of the masculine ka. They could also be seen as the personification of the creative potential in the primeaval water from which everything was created.</p>\n<p>They were generally depicted as women bearing a shield with two crossed arrows above it (the symbol of Neith). Occasionally, they were also depicted as kneeling women holding a child in their arms. According to the Memphite Theology they were created by Ptah but in Sais they were closely connected with Neith who was said to have drawn them from the waters of Nun.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aker.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ancient Egypt Wings.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Djed.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Egypt myth stub.JPG"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Eye of Horus bw.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Kheper.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Pyramidi aavikolla.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Symbol book class2.svg"}]}

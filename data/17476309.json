Devotees consider her to be the guardian deity against the cholera disease, protecting those who worship her against the disease, which plagued communities across Bengal.

The worship of Oladevi as the Goddess of Cholera is believed to have emerged in the 19th century CE with the spreading of the disease in the Indian subcontinent. The importance of Oladevi extends across communal lines and caste barriers. However, the significance of her worship has diminished in modern times as outbreaks of cholera have been reduced considerably by advancements in medicine and sanitation.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chandi</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Bangladesh Roundel.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Flag of Bangladesh.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Om symbol.svg"}]}

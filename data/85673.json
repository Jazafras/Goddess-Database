The Greek equivalent deity was Arete. He/she was identified with the Roman god Honos (personification of honour) and was often honoured together with him, such as in the Temple of Virtus and Honos at the Porta Capena in Rome itself.</p>\n<p>This deity was represented in a variety of ways, for example, on the coins of Tetricus, it can appear as a matron, an old man, or a young man, with a javelin or only clothed in a cape. Within the realm of funerary reliefs Virtus is never shown without a male companion. Often her presence within this realm of art is to compliment and provide assistance to the protagonist of the relief during a scene of intense masculinity or bravery.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modern_era\">Modern era</span></h2>\n<p>In 1776, Virtus was made the central figure in Seal of Virginia and the subsequent state's flag, which features the seal. The Virginia four-dollar note, a Continental currency, had a similar Virtus pictured on its obverse.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Tetricus-virtus.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Virginia 4-Dollars 1776 obv.jpg"}]}

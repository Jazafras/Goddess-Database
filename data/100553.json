After the decline of Buddhism in India, Sakta and Buddhist goddesses were combined to form this list of ten.</p>\n<p>The development of Mahavidyas represents an important turning point in the history of Shaktism as it marks the rise of Bhakti aspect in Shaktism, which reached its zenith in 1700 CE. First sprung forth in the post-Puranic age, around 6th century C.E., it was a new theistic movement in which the supreme being was envisioned as female. A fact epitomized by texts like Devi-Bhagavata Purana, especially its last nine chapters (31-40) of the seventh <i>skandha</i>, which are known as the <i>Devi Gita</i>, and soon became central texts of Shaktism.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>The name Mahavidyas comes from the Sanskrit roots, with <i>maha</i> meaning 'great' and <i>vidya</i> meaning, 'revelation, manifestation, knowledge, or wisdom.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Names\">Names</span></h2>\n<p>Shaktas believe, \"the one Truth is sensed in ten different facets; the Divine Mother is adored and approached as ten cosmic personalities,\" the Dasa-Mahavidya (\"ten-Mahavidyas\").

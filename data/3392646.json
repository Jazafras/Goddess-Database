Her name means <i>\"the shining one\"</i>, and she is sometimes associated with the planet Venus. By a play on words her name was interpreted as <i>z\u0113r-b\u0101n\u012btu</i>, or \"creatress of seed\", and is thereby associated with the goddess Aruru, who, according to Babylonian myth, created mankind.</p>\n<p>Her marriage with Marduk was celebrated annually at New Year in Babylon. She was worshipped via the rising moon, and was often depicted as being pregnant. She is also known as <b>Erua</b>.

Outraged, her people came to rescue her and burned down the village. Dzelarhons was nowhere to be found; in her place was a stone statue holding a burning staff. She was now a powerful goddess and guardian of animals. One story describes her vengeance against some villagers who were so used to having an abundance of fish in their waters that they began to kill fish needlessly, and torture them for their amusement. Dzelarhons the Volcano Woman rumbled and erupted, killing them with her fiery rage.</p>\n<p>The Dzalarhons Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named after her.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation book\">Cameron, Anne (2015). <i>Dzelarhons: Mythology of the Northwest Coast</i>.

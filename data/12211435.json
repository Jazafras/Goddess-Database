Spenta suggests a creative and constructive quality or force while Armaiti means regulative thought originally alluding to the physical laws of nature (i.e. Physics). While older sources present the Amesha Spentas more as abstract entities in later sources, Spenta comes to denote holiness and sanctity and Spenta Armaiti is personified as a female divinity thus its association with the female virtue of devotion (to family, husband, and child). She is associated with earth and Mother Nature.</p>\n<p>In the Armenian mythology, her name appears as <b>Sandaramet</b> (Armenian: <span lang=\"hy\" xml:lang=\"hy\">\u054d\u0561\u0576\u0564\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0574\u0565\u057f</span>).</p>\n<p>In the Zoroastrian calendar, she is associated with the twelfth month (Persian: <span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\" xml:lang=\"fa\">\u0633\u067e\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0630</span>\u200e\u200e <span title=\"Persian transliteration\">Spend\u0101rmad</span>) and the fifth day of the month.

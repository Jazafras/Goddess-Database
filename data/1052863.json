{"pageid": 1052863, "ns": 0, "title": "Trebaruna", "extract": "<p><b>Trebaruna</b>, also <i>Treborunnis</i> and possibly <i>*Trebarunu</i> was a Lusitanian deity, probably a goddess.</p>\n<p>Trebaruna's cult was located in the cultural area of Gallaecia and Lusitania (in the territory of modern Galicia (Spain) and Portugal). Her name could be derived from the Celtic <i>*trebo</i> (home) and <i>*runa</i> (secret, mystery), suggesting a protector or protectress of property, home and families.</p>\n<p>Two small altars dedicated to this goddess were found in Portugal, one in Roman-Lusitanian Egitania (current Proen\u00e7a-a-Velha) and another in Lardosa. The Tavares Proen\u00e7a Regional Museum in Castelo Branco now contains the altar from Lardosa. It was located in an area where the people from a Castro settlement founded a Roman-Lusitanian villa. This altar used to hold a statue of the goddess which has since been lost. Nevertheless, it still preserves these inscriptions: <small>TREBARONNE V(otum) S(Olvit) OCONUS OCONIS f(ilius)</small>. Which translate as: <i>Oconus, son of Oco, has fulfilled the vow to Trebaruna.</i> A name <i>Trebarune</i> (probably in the dative case) also appears on the inscription of Cabe\u00e7o das Fr\u00e1guas as a divinity receiving a sacrifice of a sheep.</p>\n<p>Following the announcement in 1895 by Jos\u00e9 Leite de Vasconcelos of the discovery of <i>Trebaruna</i> as a new theonym, a poem celebrating this was published which likened Trebaruna to the Roman Victoria. She has recently become among neo-Pagans, a goddess of battles and alliances. The Portuguese metal-band Moonspell composed a song called \"Trebaruna\" which is a celebration of the goddess.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>List of Lusitanian deities</li>\n<li>Lusitanian mythology</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

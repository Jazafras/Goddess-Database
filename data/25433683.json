{"pageid": 25433683, "ns": 0, "title": "Gaillimh inion Breasail", "extract": "<p><b>Gaillimh inion Breasail</b> is the name of the mythical woman from whom the river and city of Galway, Ireland, derives its name.</p>\n<p>According to James Hardiman, quoting Lughaidh \u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh, \"that the city of Galway took its name from the river, in which was drowned <i>Gaillimh</i>, the daughter of Breasail.\" Hardiman goes on to state that in the mid-17th map of the town, \"a rock is shown in the river\" (now called the Corrib), \"where\" it is stated, that \"a woman, named Galva, was drowned, near a great rock, in the river,\" (which is delineated on the map) \"and that from this circumstance the town originally took its name.\"</p>\n<p>She was said to be the daughter of a chief of the Fir Bolg, Breasail. It is now generally held that she was a tribal or local goddess of the river, much like other Gaelic deities such as Boann. The etymology of the name is thought to translate, roughly, as <i>stony river</i>, and probably dates back to at least the late Irish pre-historic era.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Boann</li>\n<li>Brazil (mythical island)</li>\n<li>Clodagh</li>\n<li>Danu</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li><i>Beatha Aodha Ruaidh U\u00ed Dhomhnaill</i>, Lughaidh \u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh, a.1603-b.1616</li>\n<li><i>History of Galway</i>, James Hardiman, 1820</li>\n<li><i>Early Irish History and Mythology, T.F.

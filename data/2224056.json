{"pageid": 2224056, "ns": 0, "title": "Uni (mythology)", "extract": "<p><b>Uni</b> was the supreme goddess of the Etruscan pantheon and the patron goddess of Perugia. Uni was identified by the Etruscans as their equivalent of Juno in Roman mythology and Hera in Greek mythology. Among the pre-Roman Latin tribes, the goddess was worshipped as Uni: a single triad made up of the maiden Juventas, the mother Juno, and the wise Minerva.</p>\n<p>Later, the Etruscans and early Romans, substituted the chief god Jupiter for Juventas, creating another kind of triad altogether. With her husband Tinia and daughter Menrva, she was part of another powerful triad.</p>\n<p>Uni appears in the Etruscan text on the Pyrgi Tablets as the translation of the Phoenician goddess Astarte.</p>\n<p>Livy states (Book V, <i>Ab Urbe Condita</i>) that Juno was an Etruscan goddess of the Veientes, who was adopted ceremonially into the Roman pantheon when Veii was sacked in 396 BC. This seems to refer to Uni. She also appears on the Liver of Piacenza.</p>\n<p>In the Etruscan tradition, it is Uni who grants access to immortality to the demigod Hercle (Greek Heracles, Latin Hercules) by offering her breast milk to him.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:H\u00e9raldique meuble Soleil avec visage.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Uni et hercle.jpg"}]}

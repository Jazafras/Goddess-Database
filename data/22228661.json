It is generally thought the first element is a Celtic one, <i>*trebo-</i> (or a cognate with it) meaning a house or dwelling place. The second element is interpreted either as \"protector\", or as the attested Lepontic/Ligurian word <i>pala</i>, probably meaning a sacred stone, or as \"flat land.\" <i>Trebopala</i> is therefore said to mean either <i>Protector of the Home</i>, <i>Plain of the Home</i> or <i>Altar of the Home</i>. In the inscription, Trebopala is recorded as receiving a sheep (<i>oilam</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>List of Lusitanian deities</li>\n<li>Trebaruna</li>\n<li>Reo</li>\n</ul>"}

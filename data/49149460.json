They own the gold of the Moon and the silver of the Sun, spin golden and silver yarns, and weave clothes out of them. In Kalevala, young maidens ask P\u00e4iv\u00e4t\u00e4r and Kuutar to give them some of their golden and silver jewellery and clothes. Both goddesses are described as great beauties.</p>\n<p>Professor Anna-Leena Siikala finds it possible that P\u00e4iv\u00e4t\u00e4r was a goddess who ruled over life and light. During Christian period, she was replaced by Virgin Mary.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:H\u00e9raldique meuble Soleil avec visage.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Runonlaulajan k\u00e4det.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Venesarvinen hirvi.jpg"}]}

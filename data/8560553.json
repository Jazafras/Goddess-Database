She was the wife of Hun-Hunahp\u00fa, and mother to the Monkey Twins, Hun Batz and Hun Chou\u00e9n. The name \u2018Xbaquiyalo\u2019 (you must pronounce \u2018Shbakiyaloo\u2019) probably derives from \u2018X-bac-quic\u2019, that means \u2018Little and Gory Bone\u2019 or \u2018Little and Gory Kernel\u2019; \u2018<i>yal\u00f3</i>\u2019 maybe is a suffix. Maybe she descends from one Lord of Xibalb\u00e1, but it's only an hypothesis based on the fact that the name is grisly.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Crystal Clear app kedit.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Neutered kokopelli.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Wiki letter w.svg"}]}

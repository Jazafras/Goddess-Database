{"pageid": 69587, "ns": 0, "title": "Eir", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, <b>Eir</b> (Old Norse \"help, mercy\") is a goddess and/or valkyrie associated with medical skill. Eir is attested in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the <i>Prose Edda</i>, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry, including a runic inscription from Bergen, Norway from around 1300. Scholars have theorized about whether these three sources refer to the same figure, and debate whether Eir may have been originally a healing goddess and/or a valkyrie. In addition, Eir has been theorized as a form of the goddess Frigg and has been compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Poetic_Edda\"><i>Poetic Edda</i></span></h3>\n<p>In the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l</i>, the watchman Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r presents a list of the maidens that attend the lady of the keep\u2014Mengl\u00f6\u00f0\u2014that includes Eir, and states that they all sit on the hill Lyfjaberg (Old Norse \"hill of healing\" or \"healing mountain\"). The exchange between the hero Svipdagr and Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r mentioning Eir is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the exchange, Svipdagr asks if these figures will give aid if bl\u00f3ts are made to them. Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r responds that Svipdagr is correct:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span id=\"Prose_Edda\"><i>Prose Edda</i></span></h3>\n<p>In chapter 35 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Gylfaginning</i>, the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur. High lists Eir third, and says no more about her other than noting that \"she is an extremely good physician.\" In chapter 75 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i> Eir appears within a list of valkyrie names, but Eir is not included in the list of \u00e1synjur in the same chapter.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Skaldic_poetry_and_runic_inscription\">Skaldic poetry and runic inscription</span></h3>\n<p>In skaldic poetry, the name Eir is frequent in kennings for women. A sample construction is <i>Eir aura</i> (\"Eir of riches\"), occurring in <i>G\u00edsla saga</i>. The name is already used in this way by the 10th century poets Korm\u00e1kr \u00d6gmundarson and Hallfre\u00f0r vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1ld. Similarly, the name Eir is used in a woman kenning in a runic inscription inscribed on a stick from Bergen, Norway around the year 1300. The stick records a common mercantile transaction followed by a verse from a displeased scribe (edits applied per the translator's notes):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd>'Wise Var of wire [\"woman of filigree,\" meaning \"wise bejeweled woman\"] makes (me) sit unhappy.</dd>\n<dd>Eir [woman] of mackerels' ground [likely gold] takes often and much sleep from me.'</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n<p>Mindy Macleod and Bernard Mees posit that the first line of the inscription essentially means \"women make me miserable\" or potentially \"marriage makes me miserable,\" whereas the second line means \"women often take a lot of sleep from me.\"</p>\n<p>The name remained frequently used in woman kennings in r\u00edmur poetry.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Theories\">Theories</span></h2>\n<p>Regarding the seemingly three different, seemingly conflicting, mentions of Eir, Andy Orchard says that the etymology of the name <i>Eir</i> may appear to fit the role of Eir as a goddess and servant of Mengl\u00f6\u00f0 best, but that one should consider that the valkyries also have the ability to waken the dead. John Lindow is skeptical of there having been a belief in Eir as a goddess, stating that \"whether we should trust Snorri and imagine the existence of a goddess Eir is problematic\". Rudolf Simek says that Eir may originally have been simply a valkyrie rather than a goddess, and lists the servant of Mengl\u00f6\u00f0 by the same name as a separate figure.</p>\n<p>Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that \"virtually nothing\" is known about Eir outside of her association with healing, and points out that she is \"singled out as one of the Norns who shape the lives of children\". Davidson adds that \"no satisfactory conclusions\" have been drawn from her name, and considers all mentions of Eir as of the same figure. Davidson says that, in reference to Eir's appearance among Mengl\u00f6\u00f0's maidens, that the names of these maidens \"suggest that they are guardian spirits, and [they are] said to 'shelter and save' those who make offerings of them. They could be akin to protective spirits of the house, guarding both men and women.\" She additionally draws a link between these spirits and Lyfjaberg:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lyfjaberg is where the goddess sits surrounded by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess\u2014or indeed by a god either\u2014has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, there is no doubt that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Henry Adams Bellows proposes a relationship between Eir and the place name <i>Lyfjaberg</i>, which he translates as \"hill of healing\". Bellows notes that manuscripts vary about the spelling of the place name, and that he, like others, has followed 19th-century scholar Sophus Bugge's choice. Bellows states that the stanza mentioning Lyfjaberg \"implies that Mengloth is a goddess of healing, and hence, perhaps an hypostasis of Frigg, as already intimated by her name [...]. In stanza 54, Eir appears as one of Mengloth's handmaidens, and Eir, according to Snorri (<i>Gylfaginning, 35</i>) is herself the Norse Hygeia. Compare this stanza to stanza 32.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Mengl\u00f6\u00f0 and Nine Maidens by Froelich.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Symbol support vote.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Valkyrie by Robert Engels (black and white).png"}]}

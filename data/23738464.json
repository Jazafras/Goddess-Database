She is considered the patron saint of love, money, and general happiness within the 21 Divisions. She is often considered extremely flirtatious, generous, and playful by her devotees. She is also very jealous of the worship of other female loas, as she considers herself able to provide for anything a person could request. In Roman Catholicism, she is syncretized with Saint Anne and her altars are often decorated with pictures and statues of Saint Anne and the child Mary. She is said to work very well with Belie Belcan, another popular loa who is associated with Saint Michael the Archangel. Therefore, one will always find icons of Saint Anne next to icons of Saint Michael in Vodou households and temples. Her feast day is celebrated on 26 July and her favorite colors are yellow and pink. Some people consider Cachita to be one of her \"puntos\" (or incarnations).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ochun</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Anaisa Pie Danto/Anaisa Pye, SanteriaReligion101</li>\n<li>Anaisa Pie, Papa Boko Y Las 21 Divisiones Dominican Vodou</li>\n<li>Anaisa Pye, International Vodou Society</li>\n<li>Anaisa Py\u00e9 (Archived 2009-10-25), Ozzie's Dominican Voodun</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:P religion world.svg"}]}

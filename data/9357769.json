{"pageid": 9357769, "ns": 0, "title": "List of Roman deities", "extract": "<p>A vast number of ancient <b>Roman deities</b> are known by name. The most familiar today are those the Romans identified with Greek counterparts (see <i>interpretatio graeca</i>), integrating Greek myths, iconography, and sometimes religious practices into Roman culture, including Latin literature, Roman art, and religious life as it was experienced throughout the Empire. Many of the Romans' own gods remain obscure, known only by name and function, through inscriptions and texts that are often fragmentary\u2014particularly those who belong to the archaic religion of the Romans dating back to the era of kings, the so-called \"religion of Numa,\" perpetuated or revived over the centuries. Some archaic deities have Italic or Etruscan counterparts, as identified both by ancient sources and by modern scholars. Throughout the Empire, the deities of peoples in the provinces were given new theological interpretations in light of functions or attributes they shared with Roman deities.</p>\n<p>An extensive alphabetical list follows a survey of theological groups as constructed by the Romans themselves. For cult pertaining to deified Roman emperors <i>(divi)</i>, see Imperial cult.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Roman_god_lists\">Roman god lists</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Triads\">Triads</span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>Archaic Triad</b>: Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus.</li>\n<li><b>Capitoline Triad</b>: Jupiter, Juno, Minerva</li>\n<li><b>Plebeian</b> or <b>Aventine Triad</b>: Ceres, Liber, Libera, dating to 493 BC.</li>\n</ul><h3><span id=\"Groupings_of_twelve\">Groupings of twelve</span></h3>\n<h4><span id=\"Lectisternium_of_217_BC\">Lectisternium of 217 BC</span></h4>\n<p>A lectisternium is a banquet for the gods, at which they appear as images seated on couches, as if present and participating. In describing the lectisternium of the Twelve Great gods in 217 BC, the Augustan historian Livy places the deities in gender-balanced pairs:</p>\n<ul><li>Jupiter-Juno</li>\n<li>Neptune-Minerva</li>\n<li>Mars-Venus</li>\n<li>Apollo-Diana</li>\n<li>Vulcan-Vesta</li>\n<li>Mercury-Ceres</li>\n</ul><p>Divine male-female complements such as these, as well as the anthropomorphic influence of Greek mythology, contributed to a tendency in Latin literature to represent the gods as \"married\" couples or (as in the case of Venus and Mars) lovers.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Dii_Consentes\"><i>Dii Consentes</i></span></h4>\n<p>Varro uses the name <i>Dii Consentes</i> for twelve deities whose gilded images stood in the forum. These were also placed in six male-female pairs. Although individual names are not listed, they are assumed to be the deities of the lectisternium. A fragment from Ennius, within whose lifetime the lectisternium occurred, lists the same twelve deities by name, though in a different order from that of Livy: <i>Juno, Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Jove, Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo.</i></p>\n<p>The <i>Dii Consentes</i> are sometimes seen as the Roman equivalent of the Greek Olympians. The meaning of <i>Consentes</i> is subject to interpretation, but is usually taken to mean that they form a council or consensus of deities.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Di_Flaminales\"><i>Di Flaminales</i></span></h3>\n<h4><span id=\"The_three_Roman_deities_cultivated_by_major_flamens\">The three Roman deities cultivated by major flamens</span></h4>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Twelve_Roman_deities_attended_by_the_minor_flamens\">Twelve Roman deities attended by the minor flamens</span></h4>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Di_selecti\"><i>Di selecti</i></span></h3>\n<p>Varro gives a list of twenty principal gods of Roman religion:</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Sabine_gods\">Sabine gods</span></h3>\n\n<p>Varro, who was himself of Sabine origin, gives a list of Sabine gods who were adopted by the Romans:</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Varro claims Sol Indiges, who had a sacred grove at Lavinium, as Sabine but at the same time equates him with Apollo. Of those listed, he writes, \"several names have their roots in both languages, as trees that grow on a property line creep into both fields. Saturn, for instance, can be said to have another origin here, and so too Diana.\" Varro makes various claims for Sabine origins throughout his works, some more plausible than others, and his list should not be taken at face value. But the importance of the Sabines in the early cultural formation of Rome is evidenced, for instance, by the bride abduction of the Sabine women by Romulus's men, and in the Sabine ethnicity of Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome, to whom are attributed many of Rome's religious and legal institutions. Varro, however, says that the altars to most of these gods were established at Rome by King Tatius as the result of a vow (<i>votum</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Collectives\">Collectives</span></h2>\n<p>Even in invocations, which generally required precise naming, the Romans sometimes spoke of gods as groups or collectives rather than naming them as individuals. Some groups, such as the Camenae and Parcae, were thought of as a limited number of individual deities, even though the number of these might not be given consistently in all periods and all texts. The following groups, however, are numberless collectives.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Spatial_tripartition\">Spatial tripartition</span></h3>\n<p>Varro grouped the gods broadly into three divisions of heaven, earth, and underworld:</p>\n<ul><li><i>di superi</i>, the gods above or heavenly gods, whose altars were designated as <i>altaria</i>.</li>\n<li><i>di terrestres</i>, \"terrestrial gods,\" whose altars were designated as <i>arae.</i></li>\n<li><i>di inferi</i>, the gods below, that is, the gods of the underworld, infernal or chthonic gods, whose altars were <i>foci</i>, fire pits or specially constructed hearths.</li>\n</ul><p>More common is a dualistic contrast between <i>superi</i> and <i>inferi</i>.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Di_indigetes_and_novensiles\"><i>Di indigetes</i> and <i>novensiles</i></span></h3>\n<p>The <i>di indigetes</i> were thought by Georg Wissowa to be Rome's indigenous deities, in contrast to the <i>di novensides</i> or <i>novensiles</i>, \"newcomer gods\". No ancient source, however, poses this dichotomy, which is not generally accepted among scholars of the 21st century. The meaning of the epithet <i>indiges</i> (singular) has no scholarly consensus, and <i>noven</i> may mean \"nine\" <i>(novem)</i> rather than \"new\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Titles_and_honorifics\">Titles and honorifics</span></h2>\n<p>Certain honorifics and titles could be shared by different gods, divine personifications, demi-gods and <i>divi</i> (deified mortals).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Augustus_and_Augusta\"><i>Augustus</i> and <i>Augusta</i></span></h3>\n<p><i>Augustus</i>, \"the elevated or august one\" (masculine form) is an honorific and title awarded to Octavian in recognition of his unique status, the extraordinary range of his powers, and the apparent divine approval of his principate. After his death and deification, the title was awarded to each of his successors. It also became a near ubiquitous title or honour for various minor local deities, including the <i>Lares Augusti</i> of local communities, and obscure provincial deities such as the North African <i>Marazgu Augustus</i>. This extension of an Imperial honorific to major and minor deities of Rome and her provinces is considered a ground-level feature of Imperial cult.</p>\n<p><i>Augusta</i>, the feminine form, is an honorific and title associated with the development and dissemination of Imperial cult as applied to Roman Empresses, whether living, deceased or deified as <i>divae</i>. The first Augusta was Livia, wife of Octavian, and the title is then shared by various state goddesses including Bona Dea, Ceres, Juno, Minerva, and Ops; by many minor or local goddesses; and by the female personifications of Imperial virtues such as Pax and Victoria.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Bonus_and_Bona\"><i>Bonus</i> and <i>Bona</i></span></h3>\n<p>The epithet <i>Bonus</i>, \"the Good,\" is used in Imperial ideology with abstract deities such as <i>Bona Fortuna</i> (\"Good Fortune\"), <i>Bona Mens</i> (\"Good Thinking\" or \"Sound Mind\"), and <i>Bona Spes</i> (\"Valid Hope,\" perhaps to be translated as \"Optimism\"). During the Republic, the epithet may be most prominent with Bona Dea, \"the Good Goddess\" whose rites were celebrated by women. Bonus Eventus, \"Good Outcome\", was one of Varro's twelve agricultural deities, and later represented success in general.</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Caelestis\"><i>Caelestis</i></span></h3>\n<p>From the middle Imperial period, the title <i>Caelestis</i>, \"Heavenly\" or \"Celestial\" is attached to several goddesses embodying aspects of a single, supreme Heavenly Goddess. The <i>Dea Caelestis</i> was identified with the constellation Virgo (\"The Virgin\"), who holds the divine balance of justice. In the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Apuleius, the protagonist Lucius prays to the Hellenistic Egyptian goddess Isis as <i>Regina Caeli</i>, \"Queen of Heaven\", who is said to manifest also as Ceres, \"the original nurturing parent\"; Heavenly Venus <i>(Venus Caelestis)</i>; the \"sister of Phoebus\", that is, Diana or Artemis as she is worshipped at Ephesus; or Proserpina as the triple goddess of the underworld. Juno Caelestis was the Romanised form of the Carthaginian Tanit.</p>\n<p>Grammatically, the form <i>Caelestis</i> can also be a masculine word, but the equivalent function for a male deity is usually expressed through syncretization with Caelus, as in <i>Caelus Aeternus Iuppiter,</i> \"Jupiter the Eternal Sky.\"</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Invictus\"><i>Invictus</i></span></h3>\n\n<p><b><i>Invictus</i> (\"Unconquered, Invincible\")</b> was in use as a divine epithet by the early 3rd century BC. In the Imperial period, it expressed the invincibility of deities embraced officially, such as Jupiter, Mars, Hercules, and Sol. On coins, calendars, and other inscriptions, Mercury, Saturn, Silvanus, Fons, Serapis, Sabazius, Apollo, and the Genius are also found as <i>Invictus.</i> Cicero considers it a normal epithet for Jupiter, in regard to whom it is probably a synonym for <i>Omnipotens</i>. It is also used in the Mithraic mysteries.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mater_and_Pater\"><i>Mater</i> and <i>Pater</i></span></h3>\n<p><i>Mater</i> (\"Mother\") was an honorific that respected a goddess's maternal authority and functions, and not necessarily \"motherhood\" per se. Early examples included Terra Mater (Mother Earth) and the Mater Larum (Mother of the Lares). Vesta, a goddess of chastity usually conceived of as a virgin, was honored as <i>Mater</i>. A goddess known as Stata Mater was a compital deity credited with preventing fires in the city.</p>\n<p>From the middle Imperial era, the reigning Empress becomes <i>Mater castrorum et senatus et patriae</i>, the symbolic Mother of military camps, the senate, and the fatherland. The Gallic and Germanic cavalry <i>(auxilia)</i> of the Roman Imperial army regularly set up altars to the \"Mothers of the Field\" (<i>Campestres</i>, from <i>campus</i>, \"field,\" with the title <i>Matres</i> or <i>Matronae</i>). See also Magna Mater (Great Mother) following.</p>\n<p>Gods were called <i>Pater</i> (\"Father\") to signify their preeminence and paternal care, and the filial respect owed to them. <i>Pater</i> was found as an epithet of Dis, Jupiter, Mars, and Liber, among others.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Magna_Mater\">Magna Mater</span></h4>\n<p>\"The Great Mother\" was a title given to Cybele in her Roman cult. Some Roman literary sources accord the same title to Maia and other goddesses.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Indigitamenta\"><i>Indigitamenta</i></span></h2>\n\n<p>The <i>indigitamenta</i> are deities known only or primarily as a name; they may be minor entities, or epithets of major gods. Lists of deities were kept by the College of Pontiffs to assure that the correct names were invoked for public prayers. The books of the Pontiffs are lost, known only through scattered passages in Latin literature. The most extensive lists are provided by the Church Fathers who sought systematically to debunk Roman religion while drawing on the theological works of Varro, also surviving only in quoted or referenced fragments. W.H. Roscher collated the standard modern list of <i>indigitamenta</i>, though other scholars may differ with him on some points.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Alphabetical_list\">Alphabetical list</span></h2>\n<p>For minor deities known for a single function or by a single name, see:</p>\n<ul><li><i>Indigitamenta</i></li>\n<li>List of Roman birth and childhood deities</li>\n<li>List of Roman agricultural deities</li>\n</ul><p>A number of figures from Greek mythology who were not part of Roman religious practice appear in Latin mythological narratives and as poetic allusions; for these names, see:</p>\n<ul><li>List of Greek mythological figures</li>\n</ul><p><br></p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"A\">A</span></h3>\n\n<ul><li><b>Abundantia</b>, divine personification of abundance and prosperity.</li>\n<li><b>Acca Larentia</b>, a <i>diva</i> of complex meaning and origin in whose honor the Larentalia was held .</li>\n<li><b>Acis</b>, god of the Acis River in Sicily.</li>\n<li><b>Aerecura</b>, goddess possibly of Celtic origin, associated with the underworld and identified with Proserpina.</li>\n<li><b>Aequitas</b>, divine personification of fairness.</li>\n<li><b>Aesculapius</b>, the Roman equivalent of Asclepius, god of health and medicine.</li>\n<li><b>Aeternitas</b>, goddess and personification of eternity.</li>\n<li><b>Aion</b> (Latin spelling <b>Aeon</b>), Hellenistic god of cyclical or unbounded time, related to the concepts of <i>aevum</i> or <i>saeculum</i></li>\n<li><b>Aius Locutius</b>, divine voice that warned the Romans of the imminent Gallic invasion.</li>\n<li><b>Alernus</b> or <b>Elernus</b> (possibly <b>Helernus</b>), an archaic god whose sacred grove <i>(lucus)</i> was near the Tiber river. He is named definitively only by Ovid. The grove was the birthplace of the nymph Cranea, and despite the obscurity of the god, the state priests still carried out sacred rites <i>(sacra)</i> there in the time of Augustus. Alernus may have been a chthonic god, if a black ox was the correct sacrificial offering to him, since dark victims were offered to underworld gods.

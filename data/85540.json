{"pageid": 85540, "ns": 0, "title": "Orbona", "extract": "<p>In Roman mythology, <b>Orbona</b> was the goddess who granted new children to parents who had become childless. She was also the goddess of children, especially orphans.</p>\n<p>Early Roman Mythology focused on the interlocking and complex interrelations between gods and humans. In this, the Romans maintained a large selection of divinities with unusually specific areas of authority. A sub-group of deities covered the general realm of infancy and childhood. In this area, Orbona was called upon as a general guardian and tutelary deity of children and orphans.</p>\n<p>In Tony DiTerlizzi's book <i>The Search for WondLa</i>, Orbona is the name of the planet that serves as the setting for the story. The human girl, Eva Nine, carries out a perilous search for others of her kind, accompanied by a caretaker robot and two friendly denizens of the planet. This relates to the goddess Orbona from Roman myths because she is an orphan of sorts, though accompanied by a robot she calls Muthr who has raised her in the underground Sanctuary, and she wanted to find others like her- like a parent who wants a child, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>In the HBO drama series, \"Rome\", the goddess is mentioned as the Blessed Orbona by Lyde after she joins the temple.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}]}

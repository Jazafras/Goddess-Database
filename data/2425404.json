{"pageid": 2425404, "ns": 0, "title": "Tala (goddess)", "extract": "<p><b>Tala</b> is the name of the goddess of the morning and evening star in Tagalog mythology. Her origins are varied depending on region.</p>\n<p>In one story, sun god Arao and the moon goddess Buan both had large families of stars, but Buan believed her stars could not survive the heat of Arao. They both agreed to destroy their stars. While Arao devoured his, Buan hid hers in the clouds, where they would occasionally emerge. Upon seeing this, Arao was filled with rage and is eternally in pursuit of Buan, trying to destroy her. Eclipses are explained by Arao getting close enough to bite her. At dawn, Buan hides the stars and brings them forth only when her eldest daughter, Tala (the evening and morning star) says the sun is too far away to pursue them.</p>\n<p>Derived from this myth are the Tagalog words <i>tala</i>, which means \"bright star\", <i>araw</i> (sun) and <i>buwan</i> (moon).</p>\n<p>This story has very close parallels to stories among non-Filipino cultures such as the Bihar, Semang, Savara and the Bhuiya tribes.</p>\n<p>In another myth, Tala is one of the three daughters of Bathala to a mortal woman. Her sisters include Mayari, the goddess of the moon and Hanan, the goddess of morning.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Flag of the Philippines.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:\u9f8d-seal.svg"}]}

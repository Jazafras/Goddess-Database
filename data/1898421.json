The exact role and identity of Rauni is debated, and theories range from Rauni having been a mother goddess and consort of Ukko to being identified with Ukko himself.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Interpretations\">Interpretations</span></h2>\n<p>The opinion among scholars concerning the role of Rauni in Finnish mythology is varied. Some Rauni interpret as a name for the consort of Ukko, the Finnish god of thunder. Some also identify Rauni with the rowan tree, citing the reconstructed Old Norse form <i>*raunir</i> (English: <i>rowan</i>) as linguistic evidence. Others still, among them Martti Haavio, contend that Rauni is simply an epithet for a deity called Ukko, who may or may not be the well-known Finnish thunder god, and that the other theories are based on misreading a poem documenting Finnish Pre-Christian belief authored by Mikael Agricola.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Akka</li>\n<li>Ukko</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Haavio, Martti: <i>Karjalan jumalat</i>.

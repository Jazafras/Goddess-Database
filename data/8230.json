Her cult titles include Sito (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03a3\u03b9\u03c4\u03ce</span>), \"she of the Grain\", as the giver of food or grain, and Thesmophoros (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2</span>, <i>thesmos</i>: divine order, unwritten law; <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2</span>, <i>phoros</i>: bringer, bearer), \"Law-Bringer,\" as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural society.</p>\n<p>Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the sacred law, and the cycle of life and death. She and her daughter Persephone were the central figures of the Eleusinian Mysteries that predated the Olympian pantheon. In the Linear B Mycenean Greek tablets of c. 1400\u20131200 BC found at Pylos, the \"two mistresses and the king\" may be related with Demeter, Persephone and Poseidon.</p>\n<p>Her Roman equivalent is Ceres.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>It is possible that Demeter appears in Linear A as <i>da-ma-te</i> on three documents (AR Zf 1 and 2, and KY Za 2), all three apparently dedicated in religious situations and all three bearing just the name (<i>i-da-ma-te</i> on AR Zf 1 and 2). It is unlikely that Demeter appears as <i>da-ma-te</i> in a Linear B (Mycenean Greek) inscription (PY En 609); the word <span lang=\"gmy\" xml:lang=\"gmy\">\ud800\udc05\ud800\udc14\ud800\udc33</span>, <i>da-ma-te</i>, probably refers to \"households\". On the other hand, <span lang=\"gmy\" xml:lang=\"gmy\">\ud800\udc2f\ud800\udc35\ud800\udc21\ud800\udc34\ud800\udc1b\ud800\udc0a</span>, <i>si-to-po-ti-ni-ja</i>, \"Potnia of the Grain\", is regarded as referring to her Bronze Age predecessor or to one of her epithets.</p>\n<p>Demeter's character as mother-goddess is identified in the second element of her name <i>meter</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1</span>) derived from Proto-Indo-European <i>*m\u00e9h\u2082t\u0113r</i> (mother). In antiquity, different explanations were already proffered for the first element of her name. It is possible that <i>Da</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u0394\u1fb6</span>), a word which corresponds to <i>Ge</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u0393\u1fc6</span>) in Attic, is the Doric form of <i>De</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u0394\u1fc6</span>), \"earth\", the old name of the chthonic earth-goddess, and that Demeter is \"Mother-Earth\". This root also appears in the Linear B inscription <i>E-ne-si-da-o-ne</i>, \"earth-shaker\", as an aspect of the god Poseidon. However, the <i>d\u0101</i> element in the name of Demeter is not so simply equated with \"earth\" according to John Chadwick.</p>\n<p>The element <i>De</i>- may be connected with <i>Deo</i>, an epithet of Demeter probably derived from the Cretan word <i>dea</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03b4\u03b7\u03ac</span>), Ionic <i>zeia</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac</span>)\u2014variously identified with emmer, spelt, rye, or other grains by modern scholars\u2014so that she is the Mother and the giver of food generally. Wanax (<i>wa-na-ka</i>) was her male companion (Greek: \u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, <i>Paredros</i>) in Mycenaean cult. The Arcadian cult links her to the god Poseidon, who probably substituted the male companion of the Great Goddess\u00a0; Demeter may therefore be related to a Minoan Great Goddess (Cybele).</p>\n<p>An alternative Proto-Indo-European etymology comes through Potnia and Despoina, where <i>Des-</i> represents a derivative of PIE <i>*dem</i> (house, dome), and Demeter is \"mother of the house\" (from PIE <i>*dems-m\u00e9h\u2082t\u0113r</i>).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Agricultural_deity\">Agricultural deity</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>According to the Athenian rhetorician Isocrates, Demeter's greatest gifts to humankind were agriculture, particularly of cereals, and the Mysteries which give the initiate higher hopes in this life and the afterlife. These two gifts were intimately connected in Demeter's myths and mystery cults. In Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> she is the blond-haired goddess who separates the chaff from the grain. In Hesiod, prayers to Zeus-Chthonios (chthonic Zeus) and Demeter help the crops grow full and strong. Demeter's emblem is the poppy, a bright red flower that grows among the barley.</p>\n<p>In Hesiod's Theogony, Demeter is the daughter of Cronus and Rhea. At the marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia, Demeter lured Iasion away from the other revelers. They had intercourse in a ploughed furrow in Crete, and she gave birth to a son, Ploutos. Her daughter by Zeus was Persephone, Queen of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Festivals_and_cults\">Festivals and cults</span></h2>\n\n<p>Demeter's two major festivals were sacred mysteries. Her Thesmophoria festival (11\u201313 October) was women-only. Her Eleusinian mysteries were open to initiates of any gender or social class. At the heart of both festivals were myths concerning Demeter as Mother and Persephone as her daughter.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mythology\">Mythology</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Demeter_and_Persephone\">Demeter and Persephone</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Demeter's virgin daughter Persephone was abducted to the underworld by Hades. Demeter searched for her ceaselessly, preoccupied with her loss and her grief. The seasons halted; living things ceased their growth, then began to die. Faced with the extinction of all life on earth, Zeus sent his messenger Hermes to the underworld to bring Persephone back. Hades agreed to release her if she had eaten nothing while in his realm; but Persephone had eaten a small number of pomegranate seeds. This bound her to Hades and the underworld for certain months of every year, either the dry Mediterranean summer, when plant life is threatened by drought, or the autumn and winter. There are several variations on the basic myth. In the Homeric hymn to Demeter, Hecate assists in the search and later becomes Persephone's underworld attendant. In another, Persephone willingly and secretly eats the pomegranate seeds, thinking to deceive Hades, but is discovered and made to stay. Contrary to popular perception, Persephone's time in the underworld does not correspond with the unfruitful seasons of the ancient Greek calendar, nor her return to the upper world with springtime. Demeter's descent to retrieve Persephone from the underworld is connected to the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>\n<p>Demeter and her daughter <b>Persephone</b> were usually called:</p>\n<ul><li><b>The goddesses</b>, often distinguished as \"the older\" and \"the younger\" in Eleusis.</li>\n<li><b>Demeters</b>, in Rhodes and Sparta</li>\n<li><b>The thesmophoroi</b>, \"the legislators\" in the Thesmophoria.</li>\n<li><b>The Great Goddesses</b>, in Arcadia.</li>\n<li><b>The mistresses</b> in Arcadia.</li>\n</ul><p>In Mycenaean Pylos, Demeter and Persephone were probably called \"queens\" (wa-na-ssoi).</p>\n<p>The myth of the capture of Persephone seems to be pre-Greek. In the Greek version, Ploutos (\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, wealth) represents the wealth of the corn that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (<i>pithoi</i>). Similar subterranean <i>pithoi</i> were used in ancient times for funerary practices. At the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at this time the old crop and the new meet each other.</p>\n<p>According to the personal mythology of Robert Graves, Persephone is not only the younger self of Demeter, she is in turn also one of three guises of the Triple Goddess\u00a0\u2013 Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying the ripe grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of group name. Before her abduction, she is called Kore; and once taken she becomes Persephone ('she who brings destruction').</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Demeter_at_Eleusis\">Demeter at Eleusis</span></h3>\n\n<p>Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone took her to the palace of Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse Demophon and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as Eleusis, Rarus and Trochilus. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Demeter_and_Poseidon\">Demeter and Poseidon</span></h3>\n\n<p>Demeter and Poseidon's names appear in the earliest scratched notes in Linear B found at Mycenae and Mycenaean Pylos; <i>e-ne-si-da-o-ne</i> (earth-shaker) for Poseidon, and <i>si-to-po-ti-ni-ja</i>, who is probably related with Demeter. Poseidon carries frequently the title <i>wa-na-ka</i> (<i>wanax</i>) in Linear B inscriptions, as king of the underworld, and his title <i>E-ne-si-da-o-ne</i> indicates his chthonic nature. In the cave of Amnisos (Crete) <i>Enesidaon</i> is related with the cult of Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth. She was related with the annual birth of the divine child. During the Bronze Age, a goddess of nature, dominated both in Minoan and Mycenean cult, and <i>Wanax</i> (<i>wa-na-ka</i>) was her male companion (paredros) in Mycenean cult. She and her paredros survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered\u00a0: \" Mighty Potnia bore a strong son\" However, there is no evidence that originally the name of Potnia was Demeter.</p>\n<p>Tablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for \"the Two Queens and Poseidon\" (\"to the Two Queens and the King\"\u00a0:<i>wa-na-ssoi</i>, <i>wa-na-ka-te</i>). The \"Two Queens\" may be related with Demeter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods. An exception is the myth of isolated Arcadia in southern Greece. Despoina, is daughter of Demeter and Poseidon <i>Hippios</i>, Horse-Poseidon. These myths seem to be connected with the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north during the Bronze age. Poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld and he appears as a horse as it often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and she bears one daughter who obviously originally had the form or the shape of a mare too. Demeter and Despoina were closely connected with springs and animals, related to Poseidon as a God of waters and especially with Artemis, the mistress of the animals and the goddess of, among others, the Hunt.</p>\n<p>Demeter as mare-goddess was pursued by Poseidon, and hid from him among the horses of King Onkios, but could not conceal her divinity. In the form of a stallion, Poseidon caught and covered her. Demeter was furious (erinys) at Poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she is known as Demeter Erinys. But she washed away her anger in the River Ladon, becoming <i>Demeter Lousia</i>, the \"bathed Demeter\". \"In her alliance with Poseidon,\" Karl Kerenyi noted, \"she was Earth, who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of grain or a mare.\" She bore a daughter Despoina (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u0394\u03ad\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1</span>: the \"Mistress\"), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian Mysteries, and a horse named Arion, with a black mane and tail.</p>\n<p>In Arcadia, Demeter's mare-form was worshiped into historical times. Her <i>xoanon</i> of Phigaleia shows how the local cult interpreted her: a Medusa type with a horse's head with snaky hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, probably representing her power over air and water.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>The second mountain, Mt. Elaios, is about 30 stades from Phigaleia, and has a cave sacred to Demeter Melaine [\"Black\"]... the Phigalians say, they accounted the cave sacred to Demeter, and set up a wooden image in it. The image was made in the following fashion: it was seated on a rock, and was like a woman in all respects save the head. She had the head and hair of a horse, and serpents and other beasts grew out of her head. Her chiton reached right to her feet, and she held a dolphin in one hand, a dove in the other. Why they made the <i>xoanon</i> like this should be clear to any intelligent man who is versed in tradition. They say they named her Black because the goddess wore black clothing. However, they cannot remember who made this xoanon or how it caught fire; but when it was destroyed the Phigalians gave no new image to the goddess and largely neglected her festivals and sacrifices, until finally barrenness fell upon the land.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Titles_and_functions\">Titles and functions</span></h2>\n\n<p>Demeter's epithets show her many religious functions. She was the \"Corn-Mother\" who blesses the harvesters. Some cults interpreted her as \"Mother-Earth\". Demeter may be linked to goddess-cults of Minoan Crete, and embody aspects of a pre-Hellenic Mother Goddess. It is possible that the title \"Mistress of the labyrinth\", which appears in a Linear B inscription, belonged originally to <i>Sito</i> (\"[she] of the grain\"), the Great Mother Demeter and that in the Eleusinian mysteries this title was kept by her daughter Persephone (Kore or Despoina). However, there is no evidence that the name of Potnia in Eleusis was originally Demeter. Her other epithets include:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Aganippe (\"the Mare who destroys mercifully\", \"Night-Mare\")</li>\n<li>Potnia (\"mistress\") in the <i>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</i>. Hera especially, but also Artemis and Athena, are addressed as \"potnia\" as well.</li>\n<li>Despoina (\"mistress of the house\"), a Greek word similar to the Mycenean <i>potnia</i>. This title was also applied to Persephone, Aphrodite and Hecate.</li>\n<li>Thesmophoros (\"giver of customs\" or even \"legislator\"), a role that links her to the even more ancient goddess Themis, derived from <i>thesmos</i>, the unwritten law. This title was connected with the Thesmophoria, a festival of secret women-only rituals in Athens connected with marriage customs.</li>\n<li>Erinys (\"implacable\"), with a function similar with the function of the avenging Dike (Justice), goddess of moral justice based on custom rules who represents the divine retribution, and the Erinyes, female ancient chthonic deities of vengeance and implacable agents of retribution.</li>\n<li>Chloe (\"the green shoot\"), that invokes her powers of ever-returning fertility, as does Chthonia.</li>\n<li>Chthonia (\"in the ground\"), chthonic Demeter in Sparta.</li>\n<li>Anesidora (\"sending up gifts from the earth\") applied to Demeter in Pausanias 1.31.4, also appears inscribed on an Attic ceramic a name for Pandora on her jar.

She was the nurse of Trophonios to whom a chthonic cult and oracle was dedicated.</li>\n<li>Kidaria in the mysteries of Pheneos in Arcadia where the priest put on the mask of Demeter kept in a secret place.

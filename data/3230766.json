With her brother Lahmu she is the mother of Anshar and Kishar, who were in turn parents of the first gods. Lahamu is sometimes seen as a serpent, and sometimes as a woman with a red sash and six curls on her head. It is suggested that the pair were represented by the silt of the sea-bed, but more accurately are known to be the representations of the zodiac, parent-stars, or constellations.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<p>Michael Jordan, <i>Encyclopedia of Gods</i>, Kyle Cathie Limited, 2002</p>\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Chaos Monster and Sun God.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Palm tree symbol.svg"}]}

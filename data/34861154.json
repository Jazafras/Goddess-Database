{"pageid": 34861154, "ns": 0, "title": "Frijj\u014d", "extract": "<p><i><b>*Frijj\u014d</b></i> (\"Frigg-Frija\") is the reconstructed name or epithet of a hypothetical Common Germanic love goddess, the most prominent female member of the <i>*Ansiwiz</i> (gods), and often identified as the spouse of the chief god, *<i>W\u014ddanaz</i> (<i>Woden-Odin</i>).</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Name\">Name</span></h2>\n<p>The theonyms in West Germanic are Anglo-Saxon <b>*Fr\u012bg</b>, Old High German <b>Fr\u012bja</b>, Low German (Lower Saxony) <b>Frike, Freke</b> (<i>Fru Freen, Fru Frien, Fru Freke, Fru Frick, Fuik, Frie</i>) and Lombardic <b>Frea</b>. The name of the Anglo-Saxon goddess is attested only in the name of the weekday, although <i>fr\u012bg</i> (strong feminine) as a common noun meaning \"love\" (in the singular) or \"affections, embraces\" (in the plural) is attested in poetry.</p>\n<p>The name <i>* Frijj\u014d</i> (Old Norse <i>Frigg</i>, Old High German <i>Fr\u012bja</i>) ultimately derives from PIE <i>*prih-y(a)h</i>, cognate to Sanskrit <i>priya</i> \"dear, beloved\", which however in Germanic split into two etymons, one covering the semantic field of \"love, courtship, friendship\" (English <i>friend</i>), the other the field of \"freedom\" (English <i>free</i>).</p>\n<p>The weekday Friday in English is named after for the goddess Frigg (Old English <i>friged\u00e6g</i>). Friday in Old Norse was called both <i>Freyjudagr</i> and <i>Frj\u00e1dagr</i>, in Far\u00f6ese <i>fr\u00edggjadagur</i>, and in Old High German never *<i>Frouw\u00fbntac</i>, but <i>Fr\u00eeatac, Fr\u00eegetac</i>, now <i>Freitag</i>.</p>\n<p>There is some evidence that the epithet *<i>frawj\u014d</i> \"lady\" was applied to this goddess. The two names were confused from early times, especially in Old English, where the stem of <i>*fr\u012bj-</i> appears as <i>fr\u0113o-, fr\u012bo-, fr\u0113a-</i> (a contraction of <i>*\u012bj-</i> and a following back vowel) beside a less frequent stem form <i>fr\u012bg-</i> (/fri:j-/), by development of a glide between <i>\u012b</i> and a following front vowel. The two forms would originally have figured in complementary distribution within the same paradigm (e.g. masculine nominative singular <i>fr\u0113o</i>, masculine genitive singular <i>fr\u012bges</i>), but in attested Old English analogical forms are already present and the distribution is no longer complementary Jacob Grimm stated \"We gather from all this, that the forms and even the meanings of the two names border closely on one another. <i>Freyja</i> means the gladsome, gladdening, sweet, gracious goddess, <i>Frigg</i> the free, beautiful, loveable; to the former attaches the general notion of <i>frau</i> (mistress), to the latter that of <i>fr\u00ee</i> (woman).\" The linguistic discussion of these names is complicated by issues of Germanic <i>Versch\u00e4rfung</i>. Old Norse <i>Frigg</i>, <i>friggjar-dagr</i> is related to <i>frakkr</i> \"free, bold\", cognate to Old English <i>fr\u0113o</i>, Gothic <i>freis</i> \"free\".

In each of them the female figure depicted is holding a cross-shaped staff, interpreted as a distaff. IK 350 is additionally decorated with a number of crosses, and IK 259 has additional swastikas. Iconographically related are five gold bracteates found in H\u00fcfingen, Bavaria.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Freyja</li>\n<li>Frigg</li>\n<li>Perchta</li>\n<li>Holda</li>\n<li>D\u00eds</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li>John Lindow, <i>Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs</i>, Oxford University Press (2001), ISBN\u00a00-19-515382-0, p.\u00a0129.</li>\n<li>Grimm's <i>Teutonic Mythology</i>, ch.13</li>\n<li>M.

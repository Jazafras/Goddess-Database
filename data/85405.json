She was propitiated by libations poured with the left hand. The poet Horace and the playwright Plautus call her a goddess of thieves. In Rome, her sanctuary was near the Porta Lavernalis.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<p>Laverna, was an old Italian divinity, originally one of the spirits of the underworld. A cup found in an Etruscan tomb bears the inscription \"Lavernai Pocolom,\" (cf. poculum); and in a fragment of Septimius Serenus Laverna is expressly mentioned in connexion with the <i>di inferi</i>. By an easy transition, she came to be regarded as the protectress of thieves, whose operations were associated with darkness.</p>\n<p>She had an altar on the Aventine Hill, near the gate called after her Lavernalis, and a grove on the Via Salaria. Her aid was invoked by thieves to enable them to carry out their plans successfully without forfeiting their reputation for piety and honesty. Many explanations have been given of the name:</p>\n<ol><li>from <i>latere</i> (Schol. on Horace, who gives <i>laternio</i> as another form of <i>lavernio</i> or robber);</li>\n<li>from <i>lavare</i> (Acron on Horace, according to whom thieves were called <i>lavatores</i>, perhaps referring to bath thieves);</li>\n<li>from <i>levare</i> (cf. shop-lifters). Modern etymologists connect it with <i>lu-crum</i>, and explain it as meaning the goddess of gain.</li>\n</ol><h2><span id=\"Popular_culture\">Popular culture</span></h2>\n<p>Her name is used for the main antagonist in the CGI animation Barbie: Fairytopia film series. Laverna is an evil fairy who is the twin sister of the land's fairy queen, The Enchantress.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0<cite id=\"CITEREFChisholm1911\" class=\"citation encyclopaedia\">Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

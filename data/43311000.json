{"pageid": 43311000, "ns": 0, "title": "Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, the <b>sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r</b> is the unnamed wife and sister of the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, with whom he is described as having had the (likewise incestuous) twin children Freyr and Freyja. This shadowy goddess is attested in the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Lokasenna</i>, recorded in the 13th century by an unknown source, and the <i>Heimskringla</i> book <i>Ynglinga saga</i>, a euhemerized account of the Norse gods composed by Snorri Sturluson also in the 13th century but based on earlier traditional material. The figure receives no further mention in Old Norse texts.</p>\n<p>The situation is further complicated in that narratives describing the birth of Freyr and Freyja contradictorily cite the birth of the siblings occurring either after or before Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r left Vanaheimr to live among the \u00c6sir. In addition, Freyr is referred to as the \"son\" of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and the goddess Ska\u00f0i in the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l</i>.</p>\n<p>In his 1 CE work <i>Germania</i>, Tacitus describes rituals surrounding a deity by the name of Nerthus, a theonym that is etymologically ancestral to Old Norse <i>Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r</i>. However, the figure described by Tacitus is female. Based on this scholars have suggested a Proto-Germanic hermaphroditic deity or a gender aspectual pair (similar to Freyja and Freyr), identified the obscure Old Norse goddess name Nj\u00f6run as a potential name for the otherwise unnamed goddess, and in some cases identified a potential reflex of a narrative about Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and his sister-wife in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th-century work <i>Gesta Danorum</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Textual_background\">Textual background</span></h2>\n<p>In a euhemerized account of the gods in <i>Ynglinga saga</i> chapter 4, Snorri Sturluson characterizes Freyr and Freyja as the offspring of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r by his unnamed sister, to whom he was married by Vanic custom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Eddic poem <i>Lokasenna</i>, Loki also states that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r had Freyr by his sister:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In contrast, in the <i>Gylfaginning</i> section of his <i>Prose Edda</i>, after telling the story of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's unhappy marriage to Ska\u00f0i that occurred after he came to live among the \u00c6sir, Snorri states that Freyr and Freyja were born after that; Freyr is also presented as the son of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and Ska\u00f0i in the Eddic poem <i>Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l</i>. However, in <i>Ynglinga saga</i> Freyr, and presumably Freyja, accompanies Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r when he comes to live with the \u00c6sir as a hostage after the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War; and <i>Lokasenna</i> alludes to Freyja having been \"surprised\" in Vanic incest with her brother.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Scholarly_interpretation\">Scholarly interpretation</span></h2>\n<p>Scholars since Jacob Grimm have regarded the chronology in <i>Ynglinga saga</i> as more likely to be original and taken Freyr and Freyja as having been therefore born to Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r by an unmentioned Vanic wife. Jan de Vries suggested a remnant of ancient Indo-European custom. Since Nerthus in Tacitus' late-1st century <i>Germania</i> is an earth goddess, <i>terra mater</i> (mother earth), but her name is etymologically identical to his, the suggestion is that there was originally a hermaphroditic deity, or more likely that they were a married twin pair, parallel to Freyr and Freyja. Georges Dum\u00e9zil pointed out that in Saxo Grammaticus' <i>Gesta Danorum</i>, the hero Hadingus' life closely parallels Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's, including a relationship with his foster-sister Harthgrepa followed by marriage to a princess who chooses him by his feet, as Ska\u00f0i does in <i>Gylfaginning</i>. Grimm suggested that Freyja was thought of as the daughter of the female Nerthus and Freyr as the son of the male Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r. It is possible that the goddess' name survives in the uncharacterized Nj\u00f6run who appears in some skaldic kennings and in the <i>Nafna\u00feulur</i> that were later appended to the <i>Prose Edda</i>; other divine pairs with similarly differentiated names in the Old Norse corpus are Ullr and Ullin and Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn, and the Old High German Phol and Volla may also be a pair.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>"}

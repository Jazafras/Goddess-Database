{"pageid": 11353, "ns": 0, "title": "Frigg", "extract": "<p>In Germanic mythology, <b>Frigg</b> (Old Norse), <b>Frija</b> (Old High German), <b>Frea</b> (Langobardic), and <b>Frige</b> (Old English) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god Odin. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is also connected with the goddess Fulla. The English weekday name Friday (etymologically Old English \"Fr\u012bge's day\") bears her name.</p>\n<p>Frigg is described as a goddess associated with foreknowledge and wisdom in Norse mythology, the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god Odin and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir, is famous for her foreknowledge, is associated with the goddesses Fulla, Lofn, Hl\u00edn, and Gn\u00e1, and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity J\u00f6r\u00f0 (Old Norse \"Earth\"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god Baldr. Due to significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess Freyja.</p>\n<p>After Christianization, mention of Frigg continued to occur in Scandinavian folklore. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art, and receives modern veneration in Germanic Neopaganism.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology,_Friday,_and_toponymy\"></span><span id=\"Etymology.2C_Friday.2C_and_toponymy\">Etymology, <i>Friday</i>, and toponymy</span></h2>\n<p>The theonyms <i>Frigg</i> (Old Norse) and <i>Frija</i> (Old High German) are cognate forms\u2014linguistic siblings of the same origin\u2014that descend from a substantivized feminine of Proto-Germanic *<i>frijaz</i> (via Holtzmann's law). *<i>frijaz</i> descends from the same source (Proto-Indo-European) as the feminine Sanskrit noun <i>priy\u0101</i> and the feminine Avestan noun <i>fry\u0101</i> (both meaning \"own, dear, beloved\"). In the modern period, an -a suffix is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form <i>Frigga</i>. This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word <i>frig</i>.</p>\n<p>The connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis) is a matter of scholarly debate. The name <i>Freyja</i> is not attested outside of Scandinavia, like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess <i>Frigg</i>, who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *<i>Frijj\u014d</i>. Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse <i>Freyja</i> descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.</p>\n<p>Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"</p>\n<p>The English weekday name <i>Friday</i> comes from Old English \"Fr\u012bge's Day\" and is cognate with Old High German <i>fr\u00eeatac</i>. Both weekday names are result of <i>interpretatio germanica</i> that occurred at or before the 3rd or 4th century CE, glossing the Latin weekday name <i>dies Veneris</i> 'Day of Venus'. Several place names refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Origi_Gentis_Langobardorum_and_Historia_Langobardorum\"><i>Origi Gentis Langobardorum</i> and <i>Historia Langobardorum</i></span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The 7th-century <i>Origo Gentis Langobardorum</i>, and Paul the Deacon's 8th-century <i>Historia Langobardorum</i> derived from it, recount a founding myth of the Langobards, a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see Lombardy). According to this legend, a \"small people\" known as the <i>Winnili</i> were ruled by a woman named Gambara who had two sons, Ybor and Agio. The Vandals, ruled by Ambri and Assi, came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the <i>Origo</i>): \"Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory.\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counseled them that \"at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands\". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked \"who are those Long-beards?\" Frea responded to Godan, \"As you have given them a name, give them also the victory\". Godan did so, \"so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory\". Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the <i>Langobards</i> (Langobardic \"long-beards\").</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Second_Merseburg_Incantation\">Second Merseburg Incantation</span></h3>\n\n<p>A 10th-century manuscript found in what is now Merseburg, Germany, features a heathen invocation known as the Second Merseburg Incantation. The incantation calls upon various continental Germanic gods, including Old High German Frija and a goddess associated with her\u2014Volla, to assist in healing a horse:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Poetic_Edda\"><i>Poetic Edda</i></span></h3>\n<p>In the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, Frigg is mentioned in the poems <i>V\u00f6lusp\u00e1</i>, <i>Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l</i>, the prose of <i>Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l</i>, <i>Lokasenna</i>, and <i>Oddr\u00fanargr\u00e1tr</i>.</p>\n<p>Frigg receives three mentions in the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>V\u00f6lusp\u00e1</i>. In the first mention, the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son Baldr in Fensalir. Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin himself is referred to as the \"beloved of Frigg\" and his future death is referred to as the \"second grief of Frigg\". Like the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied \"first grief\" is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, Baldr.</p>\n\n<p>In the prose introduction to the poem <i>Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l</i>, Frigg plays a prominent role. The prose introduction recounts that two sons of king Hrau\u00f0ungr, Agnar (age 10) and Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish. However, wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore and there they met a crofter. They stayed on the croft for one winter. During that winter, the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.</p>\n<p>The boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said \"go where an evil spirit may get thee.\" Away went the ship and Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was king. He \"became a splendid man\". The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, \"look[ing] into all the worlds\". Odin says: \"'Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse <i>g\u0233gi</i>] in a cave? while Geirr\u00f6d, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.' Frigg answered, 'He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.'\"</p>\n<p>Odin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her \"waiting-maid\" Fulla to warn Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was inhospitable with his guests, Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is <i>Gr\u00edmnir</i>. Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r has Gr\u00edmnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Gr\u00edmnir is brought a full drinking horn by Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r's son, Agnar (so named after Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r's brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.</p>\n<p>In the poem <i>Lokasenna</i>, where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by \u00c6gir. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, \"his wife\", Frigg.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Prose_Edda\"><i>Prose Edda</i></span></h3>\n<p>Frigg is mentioned throughout the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, compiled in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Frigg is first mentioned in the <i>Prose Edda</i> Prologue (Prose Edda), wherein a euhemerized account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of folk etymology, the author attempts to associate the name <i>Frigg</i> with the Latin-influenced form <i>Frigida</i>. The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin \"had the gift of prophecy\".</p>\n<p>In the next section of the <i>Prose Edda</i>, <i>Gylfaginning</i>, High tells Gangleri (the king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of Fj\u00f6rgynn (Old Norse <i>Fj\u00f6rgynsd\u00f3ttir</i>) is married to Odin and that the \u00c6sir are descended from the couple, and adds that \"the earth [<i>J\u00f6r\u00f0in</i>] was [Odin's] daughter and his wife\". According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god Thor.</p>\n\n<p>Later in <i>Gylfaginning</i>, Gangleri asks about the <i>\u00e1synjur</i>, a term for Norse goddesses. High says that \"highest\" among them is Frigg and that only Freyja \"is highest in rank next to her\". Frigg dwells in Fensalir \"and it is very splendid\". In this section of <i>Gylfaginning</i>, Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other <i>\u00e1synjur</i>: Fulla carries Frigg's ashen box, \"looks after her footwear and shares her secrets\"; Lofn is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to \"arrange unions\" among men and women; Hl\u00edn is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deems worthy of keeping from danger; and Gn\u00e1 is sent by Frigg \"into various worlds to carry out her business\".</p>\n<p>In section 49 of <i>Gylfaginning</i>, a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow \u00c6sir about his dreams, the gods met together for a thing and decided that they should \"request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger\". Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the \u00c6sir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, Loki discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.</p>\n<p>There, Frigg asks this female visitor what the \u00c6sir are up to assembled at the thing. The woman says that all of the \u00c6sir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that \"Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all.\" The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; \"there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of Val-hall. It is called mistletoe. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from.\" Loki immediately disappears.</p>\n\n<p>Now armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the \u00c6sir are assembled and tricks the blind H\u00f6\u00f0r, Baldr's brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks \"who there was among the \u00c6sir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to Hel and try if he could find Baldr, and offer Hel a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard\".</p>\n<p>Herm\u00f3\u00f0r, Baldr's brother, accepts Freyja's request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings\u2014foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, Nanna dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband. Herm\u00f3\u00f0r locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel. Hermodr secures an agreement for the return of Baldr and with Herm\u00f3\u00f0r Nanna sends gifts to Frigg (a linen robe) and Fulla (a finger-ring). Herm\u00f3\u00f0r rides back to the \u00c6sir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a j\u00f6tunn in a cave named \u00de\u00f6kk (Old Norse 'thanks'), described perhaps Loki in disguise.</p>\n<p>Frigg is mentioned several times in the <i>Prose Edda</i> section <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>. The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the \u00c6sir and \u00c1synjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, Asgard. Frigg is one of the twelve \u00e1synjur in attendance.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Heimskringla_and_sagas\"><i>Heimskringla</i> and sagas</span></h3>\n<p>In <i>Ynglinga saga</i>, the first book of <i>Heimskringla</i>, an Euhemerized account of the origin of the gods is provided. Frigg is mentioned once. According to the saga, while Odin was away, Odin's brothers Vili and V\u00e9 oversaw Odin's holdings. Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the \u00c6sir concluded that he was not coming back. His brothers started to divvy up Odin's inheritance, \"but his wife Frigg they shared between them. However, a short while afterwards, [Odin] returned and took possession of his wife again.</p>\n<p>In <i>V\u00f6lsunga saga</i>, the great king Rerir and his wife (unnamed) are unable to conceive a child; \"that lack displeased them both, and they fervently implored the gods that they might have a child. It is said that Frigg heard their prayers and told Odin what they asked\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Archaeological_record\">Archaeological record</span></h2>\n<p>A 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modern_influence\">Modern influence</span></h2>\n<p>Frigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, Gustav III of Sweden, king of Sweden, composed <i>Friggja</i>, a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and Hans Friedrich Blunck's <i>Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust</i> in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (<i>Frigg, Freyja</i>, drawing, 1883), John Charles Dollman (<i>Frigga Spinning the Clouds</i>, painting, c. 1900), Emil Doepler (<i>Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster</i>, painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (<i>Fricka</i>, drawing, date not provided).</p>\n<p>The Finnish folk band Frigg takes its name from the deity.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>MyNDIR (My Norse Digital Image Repository) Illustrations of Feigg from manuscripts and early print books.

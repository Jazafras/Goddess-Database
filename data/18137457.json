She is a form of Parvati, the wife of Shiva. Annapurna is eulogized in <i>Annada Mangal</i>, a narrative poem in Bengali by Bharatchandra Ray.</p>\n<p>Worship of food and offering of food, is highly praised in Hinduism and hence Annapurna is regarded as a popular deity. As per legend-</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Annapurna fed the whole world along with her consort Shiva, who was begging for food on account of a whim created by her. Annapurna is usually depicted as a youthful goddess having red complexion with a face round like full moon, three eyes, high breasts and four hands. Though Annapurna is a popular deity, there are few temples dedicated to her, the most prominent being the Annapurna Devi Mandir and the Kasi Viswanath Temple in Varanasi. She is glorified in various sacred and religious literature from the Vedic period with mention in religious texts like Rudrayamala, Sivarahasya, Annapurnamantratsava, Maha Tripurasiddhanta, Annapurna Kavacha, Annapurnahavamti, Annapurnamalininaksatramalika and Bhairvahyantantra.</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>Annapurna or Annapoorna is derived from Sanskrit meaning <i>the giver of food and nourishment</i>. <i>Anna</i> (\u0905\u0928\u094d\u0928) means \"food\" or \"grains\" and <i>p\u016br\u1e47a</i> (\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923) means \"full, complete and perfect\". She is an avatar (form) of Parvati, the wife of Shiva. Food is considered the lowest of all primitive substances.

The Western world name her the \"Hindu God of Cooking\" considering her association with food items. Akshaya Tritiya is considered the birth date of Annapurna and is believed to be very auspicious for buying gold jewellery.

The Divine Mother who is worshiped as the manifestation of all material things, including food, became angry. To demonstrate the importance of her manifestation of all that is material, she disappeared from the world. Her disappearance brought time to a standstill and the earth became barren. There was no food to be found anywhere, and all the beings suffered from the pangs of hunger. Seeing all the suffering, Mother Parvati was filled with compassion and reappeared in Kashi and set up a kitchen. Hearing about her return, Shiva ran to her and presented his bowl in alms, saying, \"Now I realize that the material world, like the spirit, cannot be dismissed as an illusion.\" Parvati smiled and fed Shiva with her own hands. Since then Parvati is worshiped as Annapurna, the goddess of Nourishment.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Iconography\">Iconography</span></h2>\n\n<p>The Agamas (religious texts) describe the iconography of Annapoorna as a youthful goddess having red complexion with a face round like full moon, three eyes, high breasts and four hands. The lower left hand is depicted holding a vessel full of delicious porridge and the right with golden ladle adorned with various kinds of jewels. The other two hands depic Abhaya and Vrata pose. She is depicted with wristlet and golden jewellery which rest on the chest. She is seated on a throne with a crest of moon adoring her head. In some depictions, Shiva is shown standing to her right with a begging bowl, begging her for alms. Shankara in <i>Annapoorna Stotra</i> described the deity always holding a scripture, akshamala and opener of doors of <i>Moksha</i> in her hands in place of vessel and ladle, indicating his prayer to Annapoorna being spiritual perfection rather than food.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Literary_mention\">Literary mention</span></h2>\n<p>Annapurna is glorified in Hindu religious texts like <i>Rudrayamala</i>, <i>Sivarahasya</i>, <i>Annapurnamantratsava</i>, <i>Maha Tripurasiddhanta</i>, <i>Annapurna Kavacha</i>, <i>Annapurnahavamti</i>, <i>Annapurnamalininaksatramalika</i> and <i>Bhairvahyantantra</i>. <i>Kumara Sambhavam</i> by Kalidasa makes vivid mention about Varanasi and the deity Annapurna. <i>Devi Bhagavata</i> written during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE refers Annapurna as goddess of Kanchipuram and Visalakshi as goddess of Varanasi. <i>Skanda Purana</i> written during the 7th century states the sage Vyasa was led to Varanasi by a curse and Annapurna came as a housewife and offered him food. <i>Lingapurana</i> mentions that Siva was begging for food for his children as he could not get food in the world due to a miracle created by his consort Parvathi. Parvathi came out as Annapurna and offered food to Siva at his doorsteps. The legend of Kasi Viswanath Temple in Varanasi is associated with the story that Siva built the temple there in her honour. Adi Sankara (8th century), the proponent of Advaita school of Hinduism, has written <i>Annapurna Stotra</i>, a book glorifying the deity.

The <i>Sri Annapurna Ashtakam</i> composed by Shankaracharya is chanted by several devout Hindus around the world as a prayer for nourishment, wisdom, and renunciation. Before partaking of any food, Hindus chant the following prayer:</p>\n<p>Translation-</p>\n<p>Oh Annapurna, who is forever complete, more beloved to Lord Shiva than life. Oh Parvati give me the alms of Your grace to, awaken within me spiritual knowledge, inner freedom, prosperity, and spiritual attainment.</p>\n<p>My mother is Goddess Parvati, my father is the Supreme Lord Maheshwara (Shiva). My relatives are the devotees of Lord Shiva, wherever they are in the three worlds.</p>\n\n<p>The <i>Annapurna Vrat Katha</i> containing stories of her devotees are also recited by her devotees.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Temples\">Temples</span></h2>\n<p>Though Annapurna is a popular deity, there are few temples dedicated to her.

Her festival, the Fornacalia, was celebrated on February 17 among the thirty <i>curiae</i>, the most ancient divisions of the city made by Romulus from the original three tribes of Rome. The Fornacalia was the second of two festivals involving the <i>curiae</i>, the other being the Fordicidia on April 19. The goddess was probably conceived of to explain the festival, which was instituted for toasting the spelt (Latin <i>far</i>) used to bake sacrificial cakes.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ancient_sources\">Ancient sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ovid, <i>Fasti</i> II. 525 ff</li>\n<li>Festus, <i>De significatu verborum</i>, under <i>Fornacalia</i>, p.\u00a082 in the edition of Lindsay</li>\n<li>Plutarch, <i>Roman Questions</i> 89</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Grain supply to the city of Rome</li>\n<li><i>Mola salsa</i></li>\n<li>Vestalia</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Myth Index - Fornax</li>\n<li>William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, v. 2, page 180</li>\n</ul><p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg"}]}

Perhaps worshiped by the local Welsh-speaking Damnonii tribe who held the territory which later was to become the Kingdom of Strathclyde. The Damnonii allied themselves with Rome who recorded and mapped the Clota estuary. During the Antonine period the Romans built the Antonine Wall from the Forth to the Clyde and created a causeway stretching across the 'Clota' which linked the forts at Bishopton, Greenock and Largs, to the Antonine Wall.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>https://www.youtube.com/group/clota</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Rouelle d or Balesme Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Triskele-Symbol-spiral.svg"}]}

She was probably synonymous with Ninhursag. She was involved in the creation of humankind from clay and blood.  As Nintu legends states she pinched off fourteen pieces of primordial clay which she formed into womb deities, seven on the left and seven on the right with a brick between them, who produced the first seven pairs of human embryos. She may have become <b>Belet Ili</b> (\"Mistress of the Gods\") when, at Enki's suggestion, the gods slew one among themselves and used that god's blood and flesh, mixed with clay, to create humankind. Also known as <b>Belet-ili</b>, or <b>Nintu</b>. Alternative forms of her name include <b>Mama</b> and <b>Mammitum</b>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Chaos Monster and Sun God.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Female worshipper with tufted dress and wrapped headdress, Khafajah, Nintu Temple VII, Early Dynastic period, 2600-2500 BC, gypsum - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07453.JPG"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Palm tree symbol.svg"}]}

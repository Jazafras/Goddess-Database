In Shingon Buddhism, she is named Karitei <span>(<span lang=\"ja\" xml:lang=\"ja\">\u8a36\u5229\u5e1d</span>)</span> or Karitei-mo <span>(<span lang=\"ja\" xml:lang=\"ja\">\u8a36\u68a8\u5e1d\u6bcd</span>)</span>. Her iconography is based mostly on the <i>Dai Yakusha Nyo Kangimo Narahini Aishi J\u014djuh\u014d</i> <span>(<span lang=\"ja\" xml:lang=\"ja\">\u5927\u85ac\u53c9\u5973\u6b53\u559c\u6bcd\u5e76\u611b\u5b50\u6210\u5c31\u6cd5</span>)</span>.</p>\n<p>In Japanese tradition, Kishimojin is an aspect of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, and she bears the epithets \"Bringer of Happiness\" <span>(<span lang=\"ja\" xml:lang=\"ja\">\u6b53\u559c\u6bcd</span>)</span> and \"Giver of Children and Easy Delivery\" <span>(<span lang=\"ja\" xml:lang=\"ja\">\u5b50\u5b89\u9b3c\u5b50\u6bcd\u795e</span>)</span>.</p>\n<p>In the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, she is known as H\u0101r\u012bt\u012b M\u0101 \"Mother H\u0101r\u012bt\u012b\", and her main temple is part of Kathmandu's Swayambhunath stupa complex. She is perceived as the consort of Pa\u00f1cika and as protector of children, and is a patron of the Newar people of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur District. The Newars call her <i>Ajima</i>, meaning \"grandmother\" in the Newar language.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Narrative\">Narrative</span></h2>\n\n<p>According to myth, H\u0101r\u012bt\u012b was originally a r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012b of Rajgir at the same time that Gautama Buddha also lived there. She had hundreds of children of her own, whom she loved and doted upon, but to feed them, she abducted and killed the children of others. The bereaved mothers of her victims pleaded to the Buddha to save them. So, the Buddha stole the youngest of her sons (in a variant version, the youngest daughter), and hid him under his rice bowl. After having desperately searched for her missing son throughout the universe, H\u0101r\u012bt\u012b finally appealed to the Buddha for help.</p>\n\n<p>The Buddha pointed out that she was suffering because she lost one of hundreds of children, and asked if she could imagine the suffering of parents whose only child had been devoured. She replied contritely that their suffering must be many times greater than hers. She then vowed to protect all children, and in lieu of children's flesh, she would henceforth only eat pomegranates. Henceforth H\u0101r\u012bt\u012b became the protector of children and women in childbirth. In exchange, the Buddha gave her bodhi, which enabled her to withstand black magic and evil powers, and gave her the facility to cure the sick.</p>\n<p>In the Japanese version of the tale, Kishimojin's enlists the aid of the Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012b Women <span>(<span lang=\"ja\" xml:lang=\"ja\">\u5341\u7f85\u5239\u5973</span><span>,</span> <i>j\u016brasetsunyo</i>)</span>) to abduct and murder the children of other families. In some variants of the myth, the Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012b Women are themselves daughters (or daughters' daughters) of Kishimojin. When Kishimojin accepts the Buddha's teachings, the Ten Demon Daughters do likewise.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Lesbre, E.

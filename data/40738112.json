The noun G\u00fcn in the Turkish and Kyrgyz languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Turkic name K\u00fcn.</p>\n<p>G\u00fcn Ana is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of life and fertility, warmth and health. She is patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. She lives on the seventh floor of the sky. G\u00f6k Tanr\u0131 created the earth with rays of sun light, thus, Gun Ana took part in the creation of earth. Solar rays are also considered to be \"strings\" between the sun and the spirits of plants, animals and humans. Turks who worship Gun Ana turn towards the sunrise when praying.</p>\n<p>G\u00fcn Ana is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on Turkish mythology. According to Turkic traditions, the powerful god Kayra made the Sun and threw it into the sky. G\u00fcn Ana and Ay Ata (the Moon) were wife and husband.</p>\n<p>According to Turkic Mythology, Khagan and his wife are supposed to be the children of the sky and the Yer (Land). Ay Ata (living in the sixth floor) and G\u00fcn Ana (living in the seventh floor) are their representatives in the sky.</p>\n<p>The feast for G\u00fcn Ana is celebrated during the summer solstice in Northern Hemisphere on each 21 June.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h2>\n<ul><li>T\u00fcrk Mitolojisi, Murat Uraz, 2001, OCLC\u00a0245853289 (1994)</li>\n<li>Turkish Myths and Legends Dictionary (T\u00fcrk S\u00f6ylence S\u00f6zl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc), Deniz Karakurt (OTRS: CC BY-SA 3.0)</li>\n<li>Ziya G\u00f6kalp, T\u00fcrk Medeniyeti Tarihi II, \u0130stanbul, 1974, s. 211.</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><span>(in Turkish)</span> T\u00fcrk Mitolojisinde K\u0131rg\u0131zlar, Saadettin Ko\u00e7</li>\n<li><span>(in Turkish)</span> Halk Meteorolojisi Ekseninde Bir Melheme \u00d6rne\u011fi, Yusuf Ziya S\u00dcMB\u00dcLL\u00dc</li>\n<li><span>(in Turkish)</span> Mitoloji</li>\n</ul>"}

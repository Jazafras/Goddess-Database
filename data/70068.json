{"pageid": 70068, "ns": 0, "title": "Ska\u00f0i", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, <b>Ska\u00f0i</b> (sometimes anglicized as <b>Skadi</b>, <b>Skade</b>, or <b>Skathi</b>) is a j\u00f6tunn and goddess associated with bowhunting, skiing, winter, and mountains. Ska\u00f0i is attested in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the <i>Prose Edda</i> and in <i>Heimskringla</i>, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the works of skalds.</p>\n<p>In all sources, Ska\u00f0i is the daughter of the deceased \u00dejazi, and Ska\u00f0i married the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as part of the compensation provided by the gods for killing her father \u00dejazi. In <i>Heimskringla</i>, Ska\u00f0i is described as having split up with Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and as later having married the god Odin, and that the two produced many children together. In both the <i>Poetic Edda</i> and the <i>Prose Edda</i>, Ska\u00f0i is responsible for placing the serpent that drips venom onto the bound Loki. Ska\u00f0i is alternately referred to as <b>\u00d6ndurgu\u00f0</b> (Old Norse \"ski god\") and <b>\u00d6ndurd\u00eds</b> (Old Norse \"ski <i>d\u00eds</i>\", often translated as \"lady\").</p>\n<p>The etymology of the name <i>Ska\u00f0i</i> is uncertain, but may be connected with the original form of <i>Scandinavia</i>. Some place names in Scandinavia, particularly in Sweden, refer to Ska\u00f0i. Scholars have theorized a potential connection between Ska\u00f0i and the god Ullr (who is also associated with skiing and appears most frequently in place names in Sweden), a particular relationship with the j\u00f6tunn Loki, and that <i>Scandinavia</i> may be related to the name Ska\u00f0i (potentially meaning \"Ska\u00f0i's island\") or the name may be connected to an Old Norse noun meaning \"harm\". Ska\u00f0i has inspired various works of art.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The Old Norse name <i>Ska\u00f0i</i>, along with <i>Sca(n)dinavia</i> and <i>Sk\u00e1ney</i>, may be related to Gothic <i>skadus</i>, Old English <i>sceadu</i>, Old Saxon <i>scado</i>, and Old High German <i>scato</i> (meaning \"shadow\"). Scholar John McKinnell comments that this etymology suggests Ska\u00f0i may have once been a personification of the geographical region of Scandinavia or associated with the underworld.</p>\n<p>Georges Dum\u00e9zil disagrees with the notion of <i>Scadin-avia</i> as etymologically \"the island of the goddess Ska\u00f0i.\" Dum\u00e9zil comments that the first element <i>Scadin</i> must have had\u2014or once had\u2014a connection to \"darkness\" \"or something else we cannot be sure of\". Dum\u00e9zil says that, rather, the name <i>Ska\u00f0i</i> derives from the name of the geographical region, which was at the time no longer completely understood. In connection, Dum\u00e9zil points to a parallel in <i>\u00c9riu</i>, a goddess personifying Ireland that appears in some Irish texts, whose name he says comes from <i>Ireland</i> rather than the other way around.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, <i>Ska\u00f0i</i> may be connected with the Old Norse noun <i>ska\u00f0i</i> (\"harm\"), source of the Icelandic and Faroese <i>ska\u00f0i</i> (\u201charm, damage\u201d) and cognate with obsolete English <i>scathe</i>, which survives in <i>unscathed</i> and <i>scathing</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n<p>Ska\u00f0i is attested in poems found in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, in two books of the <i>Prose Edda</i> and in one <i>Heimskringla</i> book.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Poetic_Edda\"><i>Poetic Edda</i></span></h3>\n\n<p>In the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l</i>, the god Odin (disguised as <i>Gr\u00edmnir</i>) reveals to the young Agnarr the existence of twelve locations. Odin mentions the location \u00derymheimr sixth in a single stanza. In the stanza, Odin details that the j\u00f6tunn \u00dejazi once lived there, and that now his daughter Ska\u00f0i does. Odin describes \u00derymheimr as consisting of \"ancient courts\" and refers to Ska\u00f0i as \"the shining bride of the gods\". In the prose introduction to the poem <i>Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l</i>, the god Freyr has become heartsick for a fair girl (the j\u00f6tunn Ger\u00f0r) he has spotted in J\u00f6tunheimr. The god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r asks Freyr's servant Sk\u00edrnir to talk to Freyr, and in the first stanza of the poem, Ska\u00f0i also tells Sk\u00edrnir to ask Freyr why he is so upset. Sk\u00edrnir responds that he expects harsh words from their son Freyr.</p>\n<p>In the prose introduction to the poem <i>Lokasenna</i>, Ska\u00f0i is referred to as the wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and is cited as one of the goddesses attending \u00c6gir's feast. After Loki has an exchange with the god Heimdallr, Ska\u00f0i interjects. Ska\u00f0i tells Loki that he is \"light-hearted\" and that Loki will not be \"playing [...] with [his] tail wagging free\" for much longer, for soon the gods will bind Loki to a sharp rock with the ice-cold entrails of his son. Loki responds that, even if this is so, he was \"first and foremost\" at the killing of \u00dejazi. Ska\u00f0i responds that, if this is so, \"baneful advice\" will always flow from her \"sanctuaries and plains\". Loki responds that Ska\u00f0i was more friendly in speech when Ska\u00f0i was in his bed\u2014an accusation he makes to most of the goddesses in the poem and is not attested elsewhere. Loki's flyting then turns to the goddess Sif.</p>\n<p>In the prose section at the end of <i>Lokasenna</i>, the gods catch Loki and bind him with the innards of his son Nari, while they turn his son Narfi into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i places a venomous snake above Loki's face. Venom drips from the snake and Loki's wife Sigyn sits and holds a basin beneath the serpent, catching the venom. When the basin is full, Sigyn must empty it, and during that time the snake venom falls onto Loki's face, causing him to writhe in a tremendous fury, so much so that all earthquakes stem from Loki's writhings.</p>\n<p>In the poem <i>Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0</i>, the female j\u00f6tunn Hyndla tells the goddess Freyja various mythological genealogies. In one stanza, Hyndla notes that \u00dejazi \"loved to shoot\" and that Ska\u00f0i was his daughter.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Prose_Edda\"><i>Prose Edda</i></span></h3>\n<p>In the <i>Prose Edda</i>, Ska\u00f0i is attested in two books: <i>Gylfaginning</i> and <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Gylfaginning\"><i>Gylfaginning</i></span></h4>\n\n\n<p>In chapter 23 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Gylfaginning</i>, the enthroned figure of High details that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's wife is Ska\u00f0i, that she is the daughter of the j\u00f6tunn \u00dejazi, and recounts a tale involving the two. High recalls that Ska\u00f0i wanted to live in the home once owned by her father called \u00derymheimr. However, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r wanted to live nearer to the sea. Subsequently, the two made an agreement that they would spend nine nights in \u00derymheimr and then the next three nights in Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's sea-side home N\u00f3at\u00fan (or nine winters in \u00derymheimr and another nine in N\u00f3at\u00fan according to the <i>Codex Regius</i> manuscript). However, when Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r returned from the mountains to N\u00f3at\u00fan, he said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd>\"Hateful for me are the mountains,</dd>\n<dd>I was not long there,</dd>\n<dd>only nine nights.</dd>\n<dd>The howling of the wolves</dd>\n<dd>sounded ugly to me</dd>\n<dd>after the song of the swans.\"</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n<p>Ska\u00f0i responded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd>\"Sleep I could not</dd>\n<dd>on the sea beds</dd>\n<dd>for the screeching of the bird.</dd>\n<dd>That gull wakes me</dd>\n<dd>when from the wide sea</dd>\n<dd>he comes each morning.\"</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n<p>The sources for these stanzas are not provided in the <i>Prose Edda</i> or elsewhere. High says that afterward Ska\u00f0i went back up to the mountains and lived in \u00derymheimr, and there Ska\u00f0i often travels on skis, wields a bow, and shoots wild animals. High notes that Ska\u00f0i is also referred to as \"ski god\" (Old Norse <i>\u00d6ndurgud</i>) or \u00d6ndurdis and the \"ski lady\" (<i>\u00d6ndurd\u00eds</i>). In support, the above-mentioned stanza from the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l</i> is cited. In the next chapter (24), High says that \"after this\", Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"had two children\": Freyr and Freyja. The name of the mother of the two children is not provided here.</p>\n<p>At the end of chapter 51 of <i>Gylfaginning</i>, High describes how the gods caught and bound Loki. Ska\u00f0i is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening it above the bound Loki, so that the venom may drip on to Loki's face. Loki's wife Sigyn sat by his side and held a bowl out. The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to shake and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\"></span><span id=\"Sk.C3.A1ldskaparm.C3.A1l\"><i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i></span></h4>\n\n<p>In chapter 56 of the <i>Prose Edda</i> book <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, Bragi recounts to \u00c6gir how the gods killed \u00dejazi. \u00dejazi's daughter, Ska\u00f0i, took a helmet, a coat of mail, and \"all weapons of war\" and traveled to Asgard, the home of the gods. Upon Ska\u00f0i's arrival, the gods wished to atone for her loss and offered compensation. Ska\u00f0i provides them with her terms of settlement, and the gods agree that Ska\u00f0i may choose a husband from among themselves. However, Ska\u00f0i must choose this husband by looking solely at their feet. Ska\u00f0i saw a pair of feet that she found particularly attractive and said \"I choose that one; there can be little that is ugly about Baldr.\" However, the owner of the feet turned out to be Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r.</p>\n<p>Ska\u00f0i also included in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought impossible for them to do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Ska\u00f0i's lap, and Ska\u00f0i laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Ska\u00f0i, Odin took \u00dejazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.</p>\n<p>Further in <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, a work by the skald \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0r Sj\u00e1reksson is quoted. The poem refers to Ska\u00f0i as \"the wise god-bride\" and notes that she \"could not love the Van\". Prose below the quote clarifies that this is a reference to Ska\u00f0i's leaving of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r. In chapter 16, names for Loki are given, including \"wrangler of Heimdall and Skadi\". In chapter 22, Ska\u00f0i is referenced in the 10th century poem <i>Haustl\u00f6ng</i> where the skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir refers to an ox as \"bow-string-Var's [Ska\u00f0i's] whale\". In chapter 23, the skald Bragi Boddason refers to \u00dejazi as the \"father of the ski-dis\". In chapter 32, Ska\u00f0i is listed among six goddesses who attend a party held by \u00c6gir. In chapter 75, Ska\u00f0i is included among a list of 27 \u00e1synjur names.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Heimskringla\"><i>Heimskringla</i></span></h3>\n<p>In chapter 8 of the <i>Heimskringla</i> book <i>Ynglinga saga</i>, Ska\u00f0i appears in an euhumerized account. This account details that Ska\u00f0i had once married Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r but that she would not have sex with him, and that later Ska\u00f0i married Odin. Ska\u00f0i and Odin had \"many sons\". Only one of the names of these sons is provided: S\u00e6mingr, a king of Norway. Two stanzas are presented by the skald Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir in reference. In the first stanza, Ska\u00f0i is described as a j\u00f6tunn and a \"fair maiden\". A portion of the second stanza is missing. The second stanza reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd>Of sea-bones,</dd>\n<dd>and sons many</dd>\n<dd>the ski-goddess</dd>\n<dd>gat with \u00d3thin</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n<p>Lee Hollander explains that \"bones-of-the-sea\" is a kenning for \"rocks\", and believes that this defective stanza undoubtedly referred to Ska\u00f0i as a \"dweller of the rocks\" in connection with her association with mountains and skiing.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Theories\">Theories</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"V\u00f6lsunga_saga\"></span><span id=\"V.C3.B6lsunga_saga\"><i>V\u00f6lsunga saga</i></span></h3>\n\n<p>Another figure by the name of Ska\u00f0i who appears in the first chapter of <i>V\u00f6lsunga saga</i>. In the chapter, this Ska\u00f0i\u2014who is male\u2014is the owner of a thrall by the name of Bre\u00f0i. Another man, Sigi\u2014a son of Odin\u2014went hunting one winter with the thrall. Sigi and the thrall Bre\u00f0i hunted throughout the day until evening, when they compared their kills. Sigi saw that the thrall's kills outdid his own, and so Sigi killed Bre\u00f0i and buried Bre\u00f0i's corpse in a snowdrift.Byock (1990:35).</p>\n<p>That night, Sigi returned home and claimed that Bre\u00f0i had ridden out into the forest, that he had lost sight of Bre\u00f0i, and that he furthermore did not know what became of the thrall. Ska\u00f0i doubted Sigi's explanation, suspected that Sigi was lying, and that Sigi had instead killed Bre\u00f0i. Ska\u00f0i gathered men together to look for Bre\u00f0i and the group eventually found the corpse of Bre\u00f0i in a snowdrift. Ska\u00f0i declared that henceforth the snowdrift should be called \"Bre\u00f0i's drift,\" and ever since then people have referred to large snow drifts by that name. The fact that Sigi murdered Bre\u00f0i was evident, and so Sigi was considered an outlaw. Led by Odin, Sigi leaves the land, and Ska\u00f0i is not mentioned again in the saga.</p>\n<p>Scholar Jesse Byock notes that the goddess Ska\u00f0i is also associated with winter and hunting, and that the episode in <i>Volsunga saga</i> involving the male Ska\u00f0i, Sigi, and Bre\u00f0i has been theorized as stemming from an otherwise lost myth.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Other\">Other</span></h3>\n<p>Scholar John Lindow comments that the episode in <i>Gylfaginning</i> detailing Loki's antics with a goat may have associations with castration and a ritual involving making a goddess laugh. Lindow notes that Loki and Ska\u00f0i appear to have had a special relationship, an example being Ska\u00f0i's placement of the snake over Loki's face in <i>Lokasenna</i> and <i>Gylfaginning.</i></p>\n<p>Due to their shared association with skiing and the fact that both place names referring to Ullr and Ska\u00f0i appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular connection between the two gods. On the other hand, <i>Ska\u00f0i</i> may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Ska\u00f0i may have originally been a male deity.</p>\n<p>Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson proposes that Ska\u00f0i's cult may have thrived in H\u00e5logaland, a province in northern Norway, because \"she shows characteristics of the Sami people, who were renowned for skiing, shooting with the bow and hunting; her separation from Njord might point to a split between her cult and that of the Vanir in this region, where Scandinavians and the Sami were in close contact.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modern_influence\">Modern influence</span></h2>\n\n<p>Modern works of art depicting Ska\u00f0i include <i>Skadi und Niurd</i> (illustration, 1883) by K. Ehrenberg and <i>Skadi</i> (1901) by E. Doepler d. J. Ska\u00f0i also appears in A. Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's poem (1819) <i>Skades Giftermaal</i>. Art deco depictions of both the god Ullr (1928) and Ska\u00f0i (1929) appear on covers of the Swedish ski annual <i>P\u00e5 Skidor</i>, both skiing and wielding bows. E. John B. Allen notes that the deities are portrayed in a manner that \"give[s] historical authority to this most important of Swedish ski journals, which began publication in 1893\". A moon of the planet Saturn (Skathi) takes its name from that of the goddess.</p>\n<p>Taking her name from that of the goddess, <i>Skadi</i> is the main character in a web comic by Katie Rice and Luke Cormican on the weekly webcomic site Dumm Comics.</p>\n<p>The Eye of Skadi is a purchasable item in <i>Dota 2</i>, a real time action strategy game by Valve Corporation.</p>\n<p>Skadi can be summoned as a persona in the Empress Arcana of the <i>Persona</i> series, a JRPG series by Atlus.</p>\n<p>Skadi is an unlockable huntress in the MOBA <i>Smite</i>.</p>\n<p>The Rowing Club of Rotterdam is named after Skadi.</p>\n<p>The Skadi Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named after the goddess.</p>\n<p>The skiing and alpine club of the Te Ra Waldorf primary school in Kapiti, New Zealand is named \"Te Ra, Skadi\" (after the Maori god of the sun and Skadi).</p>\n<p>A character named Skade is introduced in \"The Burning Land,\" the fifth book of Bernard Cornwell's \"Saxon Stories\" series. She is beautiful without comparison and is purported to be a sorceress who on occasion speaks with and consoles the God Loki.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Scota</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h3>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Citations\">Citations</span></h3>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Commons-logo.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Niorder und Skadi auf dem Wege nach Noatun after an original by W Engelhard by F W Heine.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Nj\u00f6rd's desire of the Sea.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Skade by Saltza.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Skadi's longing for the Mountains.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Skadi Hunting in the Mountains by H.

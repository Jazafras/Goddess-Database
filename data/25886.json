{"pageid": 25886, "ns": 0, "title": "R\u00e1n", "extract": "<p>In Norse mythology, <b>R\u00e1n</b> (Old Norse perhaps \"robber\") is a goddess associated with the sea. According to Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda book <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i>, in his retelling of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> poem <i>Lokasenna</i>, she is married to \u00c6gir and they have nine daughters together. Snorri also reports that she had a net in which she tried to capture men who ventured out on the sea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Ran is the name of \u00c6gir's wife, and their daughters are nine, even as we have written before. At this feast all things were self-served, both food and ale, and all implements needful to the feast. Then the \u00c6sir became aware that R\u00e1n had that net wherein she was wont to catch all men who go upon the sea.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Her net is also mentioned in <i>Reginsm\u00e1l</i> and in the <i>V\u00f6lsunga saga</i>, where she lends it to Loki so that he can capture Andvari.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Attestations\">Attestations</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Poetic_Edda\"><i>Poetic Edda</i></span></h3>\n<p>Her willingness to capture sailing men is referred to in this citation from the Eddic poem <i>Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I</i> where escaping the perils of the sea is referred to as escaping R\u00e1n:</p>\n<p>Whether men drowned by her doing or not, she appears to have received those drowned at sea, as exemplified in the section called <i>Hr\u00edmger\u00f0arm\u00e1l</i> in the Eddic poem <i>Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar</i>, where the giantess Hr\u00edmger\u00f0r is accused of having wanted to give the king's warriors to R\u00e1n, i.e. to drown them:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Prose_Edda\"><i>Prose Edda</i></span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In addition, Snorri says in <i>Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l</i> that \"R\u00e1n's husband\" (<i>verr R\u00e1nar</i>) and \"land of R\u00e1n\" (<i>land R\u00e1nar</i>) are kennings for the sea. Furthermore, her close association with the sea permitted the kenning for gold \"brightness of the sea\" to be rendered as \"brightness of R\u00e1n\" (<i>gull er kallat eldr e\u00f0a lj\u00f3s e\u00f0a birti \u00c6gis, R\u00e1nar e\u00f0a</i>). Not surprisingly, the sea was also referred to as \"R\u00e1n's road\" (<i>R\u00e1nar vegr</i>), as in the following stanza by the skald Nj\u00e1ll \u00deorgeirsson quoted by Snorri:</p>\n<p>R\u00e1n was a dangerous goddess and Snorri adds a stanza of poetry by the skald Refr where the voracious sea is called \"\u00c6gir's wide mouth\" and \"R\u00e1n's mouth\".</p>\n<p>In this poem \"Gymir's wet-cold Spae-Wife (<i>v\u00f6lva</i>)\" is likely a reference to R\u00e1n, as Snorri and the skald present Gymir as another name for \u00c6gir.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs_saga_hins_fr\u0153kna\"></span><span id=\"Fri.C3.B0.C3.BEj.C3.B3fs_saga_hins_fr.C5.93kna\"><i>Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna</i></span></h3>\n<p>In the legendary saga <i>Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna</i>, Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fr and his men find themselves in a violent storm, and the protagonist mourns that he will soon rest in R\u00e1n's bed.</p>\n\n<p>The protagonist then decides that as they are to \"go to R\u00e1n\" (<i>at til R\u00e1nar skal fara</i>) they would better do so in style with gold on each man. He divides the gold and talks of her again:</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Simek, Rudolf (2007) translated by Angela Hall. <i>Dictionary of Northern Mythology</i>.

She is mentioned in texts dating from the Ptolemaic period as well as in the Book of the Dead.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Associations_with_childbirth_and_beer\">Associations with childbirth and beer</span></h2>\n<p>Tenenet was associated with childbirth and was invoked as the protector of the uterus for pregnant women. She was depicted wearing a cow uterus on her head, as was the goddess Meskhenet, who is also associated with childbirth.</p>\n<p>Tenenet was also the goddess of beer and beer brewing, and her name may have derived from the word \"tenemu\" meaning beer; because women were customarily tasked with bread-making, the making of beer was also considered to be a woman's task. The making of beer was based on specially made loaves of bread baked with barley and then fermented in jars. In this way, Tenenet was also associated with beer.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Worship\">Worship</span></h2>\n<p>Her cult centre was at Hermonthis. She was a consort of Monthu. She was later merged with Rat-Taui, Isis and Anit. Her shape was human and on her head she wore a symbol similar to Meskhenet's.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Beer in ancient Egypt</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aker.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ancient Egypt Wings.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Djed.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Kheper.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Pyramidi aavikolla.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Symbol book class2.svg"}]}

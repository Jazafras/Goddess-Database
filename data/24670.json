{"pageid": 24670, "ns": 0, "title": "Pasipha\u00eb", "extract": "<p>In Greek mythology, <b>Pasipha\u00eb</b> (<span></span>; Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c6\u03ac\u03b7</span> <i>Pasiph\u00e1\u0113</i>, \"wide-shining\" derived from <i>pas</i> \"all, for all, of all\" and <i>phaos</i> \"light\") was a queen of Crete.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Family\">Family</span></h2>\n<p>Pasiphae was the daughter of Helios, the Sun, by the eldest of the Oceanids, Perse. Like her doublet Europa, her origins were in the East, in her case at Colchis, she was the sister of Circe, and she was given in marriage to King Minos of Crete. With Minos, she was the mother of Acacallis, Ariadne, Androgeus, Glaucus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Xenodice, and Catreus. She was also the mother of \"starlike\" Asterion, called by the Greeks the Minotaur.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Mythology\">Mythology</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Minotaur\">Minotaur</span></h3>\n<p>After a curse from Poseidon, Pasiphae experienced lust for and mated with a white bull sent by Poseidon. \"The Bull was the old pre-Olympian Poseidon,\" Ruck and Staples remark.</p>\n<p>In the Greek literalistic understanding of a Minoan myth, in order to actually copulate with the bull, she had the Athenian artificer Daedalus construct a portable wooden cow with a cowhide covering, within which she was able to satisfy her strong desire. The effect of the Greek interpretation was to reduce a more-than-human female, daughter of the Sun itself, to a stereotyped emblem of grotesque bestiality and the shocking excesses of female sensuality and deceit. Pasipha\u00eb appeared in Virgil's <i>Eclogue VI</i> (45\u201360), in Silenus' list of suitable mythological subjects, on which Virgil lingers in such detail that he gives the sixteen-line episode the weight of a brief inset myth. In Ovid's <i>Ars Amatoria</i> Pasipha\u00eb is reduced to unflattering human terms: <i>Pasiphae fieri gaudebat adultera tauri</i>\u2014\"Pasipha\u00eb took pleasure in becoming an adulteress with a bull.\"</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Curse_of_Pasiphae\">Curse of Pasiphae</span></h3>\n<p>In other aspects, Pasipha\u00eb, like her niece Medea, was a mistress of magical herbal arts in the Greek imagination. The author of <i>Bibliotheke</i> (3.197-198) records the fidelity charm she placed upon Minos, who would ejaculate serpents, scorpions, and centipedes killing any unlawful concubine; but Procris, with a protective herb, lay with Minos with impunity.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"On_divination\">On divination</span></h2>\n<p>In mainland Greece, Pasipha\u00eb was worshipped as an oracular goddess at Thalamae, one of the original <i>koine</i> of Sparta. The geographer Pausanias describes the shrine as small, situated near a clear stream, and flanked by bronze statues of Helios and Pasipha\u00eb. His account also equates Pasipha\u00eb with Ino and the lunar goddess Selene.</p>\n<p>Cicero writes in <i>De Divinatione</i> 1.96 that the Spartan ephors would sleep at the shrine of Pasipha\u00eb, seeking prophetic dreams to aid them in governance. According to Plutarch, Spartan society twice underwent major upheavals sparked by ephors' dreams at the shrine during the Hellenistic era. In one case, an ephor dreamed that some of his colleagues' chairs were removed from the agora, and that a voice called out \"this is better for Sparta\"; inspired by this, King Cleomenes acted to consolidate royal power. Again during the reign of King Agis, several ephors brought the people into revolt with oracles from Pasipha\u00eb's shrine promising remission of debts and redistribution of land.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Possible_celestial_deity\">Possible celestial deity</span></h2>\n<p>In <i>Description of Greece</i>, Pausanias equates Pasipha\u00eb with Selene, implying that the figure was worshipped as a lunar deity. However, further studies on Minoan religion indicate that the sun was a female figure, suggesting instead that Pasipha\u00eb was originally a solar goddess, an interpretation consistent with her depiction as Helios' daughter. Poseidon's bull may in turn be vestigial or the lunar bull prevalent in middle-eastern religions.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_popular_culture\">In popular culture</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Pasiphae appears in the BBC One fantasy drama series <i>Atlantis</i>. Here she seems to be the main antagonist. As Ariadne's domineering stepmother, she disapproves of her attraction to Jason and tries to kill the hero several times. Her sister, Circe, seems to hold a grudge against her and asks Jason to help kill her. The last episode of season 1 (Touched by the Gods part 2) revealed that she is the mother of Jason. She thought he died after she cursed her husband and they fled to our world. She is portrayed by Sarah Parish.</li>\n<li>Pasipha\u00eb is also the name of the spa inside the hotel in the BBC's <i>Doctor Who</i> episode \"The God Complex\".</li>\n<li>Pasipha\u00eb is a major antagonist in Rick Riordan's 2013 fantasy novel <i>The House of Hades</i>. In this novel, she is portrayed as an immortal sorceress and former wife of the late King Minos. Having grown bitter towards the gods after the events of the Minoan myth, Pasipha\u00eb allies with the goddess Gaea and her giant army to overthrow the Olympian gods. She is confronted and defeated by Hazel Levesque, a demigod daughter of Pluto, who had been trained in sorcery by the goddess Hecate. In this novel, it is revealed that the Labyrinth is tied to her life force as much as Daedalus's, thereby rendering the infamous inventor's sacrifice in the previous series useless.</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Kerenyi, Karl. <i>The Gods of the Greeks</i>, 1951.</li>\n<li>Graves, Robert. <i>The Greek Myths</i>, (1955) 1960.</li>\n<li>Ruck, Carl A.P., and Danny Staples, <i>The World of Classical Myth</i> 1994.</li>\n<li>Smith, William; <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</i>, London (1873). \"Past'piiae\"</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Theoi Project - Pasiphae</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ambox important.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Commons-logo.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Pasiphae Minotauros Cdm Paris DeRidder1066 detail.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Pasiphae.jpg"}]}

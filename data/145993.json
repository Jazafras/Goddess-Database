Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 refers to this perfected way of seeing the nature of reality, as well as to a particular body of sutras and to the personification of the concept in the Bodhisattva known as the \"Great Mother\" (Tibetan: Yum Chenmo). The word <i>Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101</i> combines the Sanskrit words <i>praj\u00f1\u0101</i> \"wisdom\" with <i>p\u0101ramit\u0101</i> \"perfection\". Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 is a central concept in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism and is generally associated with the doctrine of emptiness (Shunyata) or 'lack of Svabhava' (essence) and the works of Nagarjuna. Its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the Bodhisattva path.</p>\n<p>According to Edward Conze the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Sutras are \"a collection of about forty texts...composed in India between approximately 100 BC and AD 600.\" Some Prajn\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 s\u016btras are thought to be among the earliest Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras.</p>\n<p>One of the important features of the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Sutras is anutpada (unborn, no origin).</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Earliest_texts\">Earliest texts</span></h3>\n<h4><span id=\"A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101_Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\"></span><span id=\"A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81\"><i><span title=\"International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\">A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101</span></i></span></h4>\n<p>Western scholars have traditionally considered the earliest s\u016btra in the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 class to be the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i> or \"Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines\", which was probably put in writing in the 1st century BCE. This chronology is based on the views of Edward Conze, who largely considered dates of translation into other languages. The first translation of the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101</i> into Chinese occurred in the 2nd century CE. This text also has a corresponding version in verse format, called the <i><span title=\"International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\">Ratnagu\u1e47asa\u1e43caya G\u0101th\u0101</span></i>, which some believe to be slightly older because it is not written in standard literary Sanskrit. However, these findings rely on late-dating Indian texts, in which verses and mantras are often kept in more archaic forms.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a number of scholars have proposed that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 teachings were first developed by the Caitika subsect of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas. They believe that the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i> originated amongst the southern Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika schools of the \u0100ndhra region, along the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a River. These Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas had two famous monasteries near Amar\u0101vati and the Dh\u0101nyakataka, which gave their names to the P\u016brva\u015baila and Apara\u015baila schools. Each of these schools had a copy of the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i> in Prakrit. Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i> as being that of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas. Edward Conze estimates that this s\u016btra originated around 100 BCE.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima published a damaged and partial Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b manuscript of the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101</i>. It is radiocarbon dated to ca. 75 CE, making it one of the oldest Buddhist texts in existence. It is very similar to the first Chinese translation of the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101</i> by Lokak\u1e63ema (ca. 179 CE) whose source text is assumed to be in the G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b language. Comparison with the standard Sanskrit text shows that it is also likely to be a translation from G\u0101ndh\u0101ri as it expands on many phrases and provides glosses for words that are not present in the G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b. This points to the text being composed in G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, the language of Gandhara (the region now called the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan, including Peshawar, Taxila and Swat Valley). The \"Split\" ms. is evidently a copy of an earlier text, confirming that the text may date before the first century of the common era.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Vajracchedik\u0101_Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\"></span><span id=\"Vajracchedik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81\"><i>Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101</i></span></h4>\n<p>In contrast to western scholarship, Japanese scholars have traditionally considered the <i>Diamond S\u016btra</i> (<i>Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i>) to be from a very early date in the development of Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature. The usual reason for this relative chronology which places the <i>Vajracchedik\u0101</i> earlier is not its date of translation, but rather a comparison of the contents and themes. Some western scholars also believe that the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i> was adapted from the earlier <i>Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i>.</p>\n<p>Examining the language and phrases used in both the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101</i> and the <i>Vajracchedik\u0101</i>, Gregory Schopen also sees the <i>Vajracchedik\u0101</i> as being earlier than the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101</i>. This view is taken in part by examining parallels between the two works, in which the <i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101</i> seems to represent the later or more developed position. According to Schopen, these works also show a shift in emphasis from an oral tradition (<i>Vajracchedik\u0101</i>) to a written tradition (<i>A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101</i>).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Overview_of_the_Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101_s\u016btras\"></span><span id=\"Overview_of_the_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81_s.C5.ABtras\">Overview of the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 s\u016btras</span></h3>\n\n<p>An Indian commentary on the <i>Mah\u0101y\u0101nasa\u1e43graha</i>, entitled <i>Viv\u1e5btaguhy\u0101rthapi\u1e47\u1e0davy\u0101khy\u0101</i>, gives a classification of teachings according to the capabilities of the audience:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\">\n<p>[A]ccording to disciples' grades, the Dharma is [classified as] inferior and superior.

In Khotan, however, there were numerous H\u012bnay\u0101nists who attempted to prevent it because they regarded the text as heterodox. Eventually, Zhu Shixing stayed in Khotan, but sent the manuscript to Luoyang where it was translated by a Khotanese monk named Mok\u1e63ala. In 296, the Khotanese monk G\u012btamitra came to Chang'an with another copy of the same text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span id=\"China\">China</span></h3>\n<p>In China, there was extensive translations of many Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 texts beginning in the second century CE, main translators include: Lokak\u1e63ema (\u652f\u5a41\u8fe6\u8b96), Zh\u012b Q\u012ban (\u652f\u8b19), Dharmarak\u1e63a (\u7afa\u6cd5\u8b77), Mok\u1e63ala (\u7121\u53c9\u7f85), Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (\u9ce9\u6469\u7f85\u4ec0, 408 CE), Xu\u00e1nz\u00e0ng (\u7384\u5958), F\u0103xi\u00e1n (\u6cd5\u8ce2) and D\u0101nap\u0101la (\u65bd\u8b77). These translations were very influential in the development of East Asian M\u0101dhyamaka and on Chinese Buddhism.</p>\n<p>Xuanzang (fl. c. 602\u2013664) was a Chinese scholar who traveled to India and returned to China with three copies of the <i>Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra</i> which he had secured from his extensive travels. Xuanzang, with a team of disciple translators, commenced translating the voluminous work in 660 CE using the three versions to ensure the integrity of the source documentation. Xuanzang was being encouraged by a number of the disciple translators to render an abridged version. After a suite of dreams quickened his decision, Xuanzang determined to render an unabridged, complete volume, faithful to the original of 600 fascicles.</p>\n<p>There are also later commentaries from Zen Buddhists on the Heart and Diamond sutra and K\u016bkai's commentary (9th century) is the first known Tantric commentary.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Themes_in_Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101_sutras\"></span><span id=\"Themes_in_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81_sutras\">Themes in Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Core_themes\">Core themes</span></h3>\n\n<p>An important theme in these sutras is the meaning and profundity of the perfection (<i>p\u0101ramit\u0101</i>) of <i>praj\u00f1a</i> - a state of consciousness which is an understanding of reality arising from deep thinking and analysis as well as meditative insight. It is non-conceptual and non-dual as well as transcendental.</p>\n<p>A common trope in the <i>Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras</i> is the negation of a previous statement in the form 'A is not A, therefore it is A', or more often negating only a part of the statement as in, \u201cXY is a Y-less XY\u201d. Japanese Buddhologist, Hajime Nakamura, calls this negation the 'logic of not' (Sanskrit: na prthak). An example from the Diamond sutra of this use of negation is:</p>\n<dl><dd>As far as \u2018all dharmas\u2019 are concerned, Subhuti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called \u2018all dharmas.\u2019</dd>\n</dl><p>The rationale behind this form is the juxtaposition of conventional truth with ultimate truth as taught in the Buddhist two truths doctrine. The negation of conventional truth is supposed to expound the ultimate truth of the emptiness (shunyata) of all reality - the idea that nothing has an ontological essence and all things are merely conceptual, having no true ontological essence. From the point of view of the ultimate, all things are \"like a magical illusion...like a dream\". According to Karl Brunnholzl, this \"perfection of wisdom\" means that \"all phenomena from form up through omniscience being utterly devoid of any intrinsic characteristics or nature of their own.\" Furthermore, \"such omniscient wisdom is always nonconceptual and free from reference points since it is the constant and panoramic awareness of the nature of all phenomena and does not involve any shift between meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment.\"</p>\n<p>Another key theme of the sutras is the Bodhisattva ideal and the Mahayana (Great Vehicle), which sees the goal of the Buddhist path as becoming a Buddha for the sake of all sentient beings, not just yourself:</p>\n<dl><dd>They make up their minds that \u2018one single self we shall tame . . . one single self we shall</dd>\n<dd>lead to final Nirvana.\u2019 A Bodhisattva should certainly not in such a way train himself.</dd>\n<dd>On the contrary, he should train himself thus: \u2018My own self I will place in Suchness [the</dd>\n<dd>true way of things], and, so that all the world might be helped, I will place all beings</dd>\n<dd>into Suchness, and I will lead to Nirvana the whole immeasurable world of beings.\u2019</dd>\n</dl><p>The Bodhisattva is said to generate \"great compassion\" for all beings on their path to liberation and yet also maintain a sense of equanimity and distance from them due to his understanding of emptiness, due to which, the Bodhisattva understands that even after bringing countless beings to nirvana, \"no living being whatsoever has been brought to nirvana.\" Bodhisattvas and Mah\u0101sattvas are also willing to give up all of their meritorious deeds for sentient beings and develop skillful means (upaya) in order to help them.</p>\n<p>According to Paul Williams, another major theme of the early sutras is \"the phenomenon of laudatory self reference \u2013 the lengthy praise of the sutra itself, the immense merits to be obtained from treating even a verse of it with reverence, and the nasty penalties which will accrue in accordance with karma to those who denigrate the scripture.\"</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Later_additions\">Later additions</span></h3>\n<p>According to Edward Conze, the PP sutras added much new doctrinal material in the later layers and the larger texts.

The depiction of Prajnaparamita as a Yidam deity can also be found in ancient Java and Cambodian art.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101_in_Ancient_Indonesia\"></span><span id=\"Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81_in_Ancient_Indonesia\">Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 in Ancient Indonesia</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Mahayana Buddhism took root in ancient Java Sailendra court in the 8th century CE. The Mahayana reverence of female buddhist deity started with the cult of Tara enshrined in the 8th century Kalasan temple in Central Java. Some of Prajnaparamita's important functions and attributes can be traced to those of the goddess Tara. Tara and Prajnaparamita are both referred to as mothers of all Buddhas, since Buddhas are born from wisdom. The Sailendra dynasty was also the ruling family of Srivijaya in Sumatra. During the reign of the third Pala king Devapala (815-854) in India, Srivijaya Maharaja Balaputra of Sailendras also constructed one of Nalanda\u2019s main monasteries in India itself. Thereafter manuscript editions of the <i>Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra</i> circulating in Sumatra and Java instigated the cult of the Goddess of Transcendent Wisdom.</p>\n<p>In the 13th century, the tantric buddhism gained royal patronage of king Kertanegara of Singhasari, and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of Muaro Jambi Regency, Sumatra. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.</p>\n<p>The statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom, and is considered the masterpiece of classical ancient Java Hindu-Buddhist art in Indonesia. It was discovered in the Cungkup Putri ruins near Singhasari temple, Malang, East Java. Today the beautiful and serene statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Selected_English_translations\">Selected English translations</span></h2>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Literature\">Literature</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite class=\"citation book\">Karashima, Seishi (2010). <i>A Glossary of Lokak\u1e63ema's translation of the A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101pr\u0304amit\u0101</i> <span>(PDF)</span>.

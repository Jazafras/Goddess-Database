{"pageid": 705971, "ns": 0, "title": "Shala", "extract": "<p><b>Shala</b> was an ancient Sumerian goddess of grain and the emotion of compassion. The symbols of grain and compassion combine to reflect the importance of agriculture in the mythology of Sumer, and the belief that an abundant harvest was an act of compassion from the deities. Traditions identify Shala as wife of the fertility god Dagon, or consort of the storm god Hadad' also called Ishkur. In ancient depictions, she carries a double-headed mace or scimitar embellished with lion heads. Sometimes she is depicted as being borne atop one or two lionesses. From very early times, she is associated with the constellation Virgo and vestiges of symbolism associated with her have persisted in representations of the constellation to current times, such as the ear of grain, even as the deity name changed from culture to culture.</p>\n<p>The Shala Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named after her.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses: \u0160ala (goddess)</li>\n</ul>"}

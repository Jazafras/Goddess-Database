{"pageid": 85614, "ns": 0, "title": "Rumina", "extract": "<p>In ancient Roman religion, <b>Rumina</b>, also known as <b>Diva Rumina</b>, was a goddess who protected breastfeeding mothers, and possibly nursing infants. Her domain extended to protecting animal mothers, not just human ones. As one of the <i>indigitamenta</i>, Rumina lacked the elaborate mythology and personality of later Roman deities, and was instead a more abstract, numinous entity.</p>\n<p>Rumina's temple was near the Ficus Ruminalis, the fig tree at the foot of the Palatine Hill where Romulus and Remus were raised by a she-wolf. Milk, rather than the typical wine, was offered as a sacrifice at this temple. In AD 58, the tree started to die, which was interpreted as a bad omen.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Hammond, N.G.L. &amp; Scullard, H.H. (Eds.)

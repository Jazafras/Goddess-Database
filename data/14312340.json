Occasionally, the Ashta Lakshmi are depicted together in shrines or in \"framing pictures\" within an overall design and are worshipped by votaries of Lakshmi who worship her in her various manifestations. In addition to emergence of Ashta Lakshmi temples since the 1970s, traditional silver articles used in home worship as well as decorative jars ('Kumbha') now appear with the Ashta Lakshmi group molded on their sides.</p>\n<p>Books, popular prayers manuals, pamphlets sold outside temples in South India; ritual worship and \"a burgeoning audiocassette market\" are also popularizing these eight forms of Lakshmi.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Temples\">Temples</span></h3>\n\n<ul><li>Ashtalakshmi Temple, Besant Nagar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India: The Ashta Lakshmi Kovil, built in 1974, is the first shrine dedicated exclusively to the Ashta Lakshmi where Lakshmi is given greater importance than Vishnu.

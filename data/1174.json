She is identified with the planet Venus; her Roman equivalent is the goddess <span lang=\"la\" xml:lang=\"la\">Venus</span>. Myrtle, roses, doves, sparrows and swans were sacred to her.</p>\n<p>In Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i>, Aphrodite was created from the sea foam (<i>aphros</i>) produced by Uranus's genitals, which had been severed by Cronus. In Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, however, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. In Plato (<i>Symposium</i>, 180e), these two origins are said to be of hitherto separate entities: Aphrodite Ourania (a transcendent, \"Heavenly\" Aphrodite) and Aphrodite Pandemos (Aphrodite common to \"all the people\"). She had many other names, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess, or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as <b>Cytherea</b> (<i>Lady of Cythera</i>) and <b>Cypris</b> (<i>Lady of Cyprus</i>), both of which claimed to be her place of birth.</p>\n<p>In Greek mythology, the other gods feared that Aphrodite's beauty might lead to conflict and war, through rivalry for her favours; so Zeus married her off to Hephaestus. Despite this, Aphrodite followed her own inclinations, and had many lovers \u2014 both gods, such as Ares, and men, such as Anchises. She played a role in the Eros and Psyche legend, and was both lover and surrogate mother of Adonis.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>Hesiod derives <i>Aphrodite</i> from <i>aphr\u00f3s</i> (\u1f00\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2) \"sea-foam\", interpreting the name as \"risen from the foam\". Michael Janda, accepting this as genuine, claims the story of a birth from the foam as an Indo-European mytheme. The second part of the compound has been variously analyzed as *<i>-od\u00edt\u0113</i> \"wanderer\" or *<i>-d\u00edt\u0113</i> \"bright\". Janda, agreeing with the latter, interprets the meaning of the name as \"she who shines from the foam (of the ocean)\", supposing the name as an epithet of Eos, the dawn goddess. Likewise, Witczak proposes an Indo-European compound <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*ab\u02b0or-</span></i> \"very\" and <i><span title=\"Proto-Indo-European language\" lang=\"ine\" xml:lang=\"ine\">*d\u02b0ei-</span></i> \"to shine\", also referring to Eos. Other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since Aphrodite's attributes are entirely different from those of both Eos and the Vedic deity Ushas. Janda disputes this assumption.</p>\n<p>A number of improbable non-Greek etymologies have been suggested in scholarship. One Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian <i>bar\u012br\u012btu</i>, the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts. Hammarstr\u00f6m looks to Etruscan, comparing <i>(e)pr\u03d1ni</i> \"lord\", an Etruscan honorific loaned into Greek as \u03c0\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, \"the lady\". Hjalmar Frisk and Robert Beekes reject this etymology as implausible, especially since Aphrodite actually appears in Etruscan in the borrowed form <i>Apru</i> (from Greek <i>Aphr\u014d</i>, clipped form of <i>Aphrodite</i>).</p>\n<p>The medieval <i>Etymologicum Magnum</i> (c. 1150) offers a highly contrived etymology, deriving <i>Aphrodite</i> from the compound <i>habrod\u00edaitos</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">\u1f01\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2</span>), \"she who lives delicately\", from <i>habr\u00f3s</i> and <i>d\u00edaita</i>. The alteration from <i>b</i> to <i>ph</i> is explained as a \"familiar\" characteristic of Greek \"obvious from the Macedonians\", despite the fact that the name cannot be of Macedonian origin.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Origins\">Origins</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Near_Eastern_love_goddess\">Near Eastern love goddess</span></h3>\n\n<p>The cult of Aphrodite in Greece was imported from, or at least influenced by, the cult of Astarte in Phoenicia, which, in turn, was derived from the cult of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, which itself was largely derived from the cult of the Sumerian goddess Inanna. Pausanias states that the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the Assyrians, after the Assyrians, the Paphians of Cyprus, and then the Phoenicians at Ascalon. The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of Cythera.</p>\n<p>Classical nineteenth-century scholars viewed the notion of a Near Eastern origin for Aphrodite with skepticism. Authors such as A. Enmann (<i>Kypros und der Ursprung des Aphroditekultes</i> 1881) attempted to portray the cult of Aphrodite as a native Greek development. Scholarly opinion on this question has shifted significantly since the 1980s, notably due to Walter Burkert (1984). The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular, is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eighth century BC, when archaic Greece was on the fringes of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.</p>\n<p>Hans Georg Wunderlich has drawn a connection between Aphrodite and the Minoan snake goddess. This theory is supported by the fact that the Egyptian snake goddess Wadjet was associated with the city known to the Greeks as <i>Aphroditopolis</i>, which means \"City of Aphrodite.\"</p>\n<p>In native Greek tradition, the planet Venus had two names: <i>Hesperos</i> as the evening star and <i>Eosphoros</i> as the morning star. The Greeks adopted the identification of the morning and the evening stars, as well as its identification as Ishtar/Aphrodite, during the 4th century BC, along with other items of Babylonian astrology, such as the zodiac (Eudoxus of Cnidus).</p>\n<p>The ancient Greeks also identified Aphrodite with the ancient Egyptian goddess Hathor.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Indo-European_dawn_goddess\">Indo-European dawn goddess</span></h3>\n<p>It has long been accepted in comparative mythology that Aphrodite preserves some aspects of the Indo-European dawn goddess *<i>H<sub>a</sub>\u00e9us\u014ds</i> (properly Greek Eos, Latin Aurora, Sanskrit Ushas). Janda etymologizes her name as \"she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]\" and points to Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i> account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the Rigvedic myth of Indra defeating Vrtra, liberating Ushas.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Forms_of_Aphrodite\">Forms of Aphrodite</span></h2>\n\n<p>By the late 5th century BC, Platonists distinguished two separate \"Aphrodites\". <i>Aphrodite Ourania</i>, the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, was thought the older form; she also inspired homosexual male desire or, more specifically, ephebic eros. The \"younger\" <i>Aphrodite Pandemos</i>, the common Aphrodite \"of all the folk\", born from the union of Zeus and Dione, inspired all love for women.</p>\n<p>Among the neo-Platonists and, later, their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Aphrodite Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Aphrodite Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love; it was the subject of a chryselephantine sculpture by Phidias for Elis, known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer Pausanias).</p>\n<p>A male version of Aphrodite known as Aphroditus was worshipped in the city of Amathus on Cyprus. Aphroditus was depicted with the figure and dress of a woman, but had a full beard, and was shown lifting his dress to reveal an erect phallus. This gesture was believed to be an apotropaic symbol, and was thought to convey good fortune upon the viewer.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Worship\">Worship</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>She was also called <i>Kypris</i> or <i>Cytherea</i> after her birth-places in Cyprus and Cythera, respectively, both centers of her cult. She was associated with Hesperia and frequently accompanied by the Oreads, nymphs of the mountains. She was also often depicted with the sea, dolphins, doves, swans, pomegranates, sceptres, apples, myrtle, rose trees, lime trees, clams, scallop shells, and pearls.</p>\n<p>Her festival, <i>Aphrodisia</i>, was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in Athens and Corinth. At the temple of Aphrodite on the summit of Acrocorinth (before the Roman destruction of the city in 146 BC), intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshiping Aphrodite. This temple was not rebuilt when the city was re-established under Roman rule in 44 BC, but the fertility rituals likely continued in the main city near the agora.</p>\n<p>Pausanias records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as <i>Areia</i>, which means \"warlike.\" This epithet stresses Aphrodite's connections to Ares, with whom she had extramarital relations. Pausanias also records that, in Sparta and on Cythera, there were extremely ancient cult statues of Aphrodite portraying her bearing arms.</p>\n<p>The cult of Aphrodite may have involved ritual prostitution. The Greek euphemism for a sacred prostitute is <i>hierodoule</i>, meaning \"sacred slave\". Ritual prostitution is attested in association with Aphrodite in Corinth and on the islands of Cyprus, Cythera, and Sicily, but it is not attested in Athens. Ritual prostitution was an inherent part of the rituals owed to Aphrodite's Near Eastern forebears, Sumerian Inanna and Akkadian Ishtar, whose temple priestesses were the \"women of Ishtar,\" <i>ishtaritum</i>. Ritual prostitution has been documented in Babylon, Syria, and Palestine, in Phoenician cities and the Tyrian colony Carthage. Aphrodite was everywhere the patroness of the <i>hetaera</i> and courtesan. In Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor, <i>hierodoulai</i> served in the temple of Artemis.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Mythology\">Mythology</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Birth\">Birth</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship, Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, which is why she is sometimes called \"Cyprian\", especially in the poetic works of Sappho. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of Cythera, hence another of her names, \"Cytherea\". Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between Crete and the Peloponesus, so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite's cult from the Middle East to mainland Greece.</p>\n<p>According to the version of her birth recounted by Hesiod in his <i>Theogony</i>, Cronus severed Uranus' genitals and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, meaning \"foam-arisen\"), while the Giants, the Erinyes (furies), and the Meliae emerged from the drops of his blood. Hesiod states that the genitals \"were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew.\" The girl, Aphrodite, floated ashore on a scallop shell. This iconic representation of Aphrodite as a mature \"Venus rising from the sea\" (<i>Venus Anadyomene</i>) was made famous in a much-admired painting by Apelles, now lost, but described in the <i>Natural History</i> of Pliny the Elder.</p>\n<p>According to the <i>Iliad</i>, Aphrodite was considered a daughter of Zeus and Dione, the mother goddess whose oracle was at Dodona.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Adulthood\">Adulthood</span></h3>\n\n<p>Aphrodite is consistently portrayed as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult, having had no childhood. She is often depicted nude. In many of the later myths, she is portrayed as vain, ill-tempered, and easily offended. Although she is married\u2014she is one of the few gods in the Greek Pantheon who is\u2014she is frequently unfaithful to her husband.</p>\n<p>According to one version of Aphrodite's story, because of her immense beauty Zeus fears that the other gods will become violent with each other in their rivalry to possess her. To forestall this, he forces her to marry Hephaestus, the dour, humorless god of smithing. In another version of the story, his mother, Hera casts him off Olympus, deeming him too ugly and deformed to inhabit the home of the gods. His revenge is to trap his mother in a magic throne. In return for her release, he demands to be given Aphrodite's hand in marriage.</p>\n<p>Hephaestus is overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forges her beautiful jewelry, including a <i>strophion</i> known as the <i>kestos imas</i>, a saltire-shaped undergarment (usually translated as \"girdle\"), which accentuated her breasts and made her even more irresistible to men. Such <i>strophia</i> were commonly used in depictions of the Near Eastern goddesses Ishtar and Atargatis.</p>\n<p>Aphrodite is a major figure in the Trojan War legend. She is a contestant in the \"Judgement of Paris\" (see below), which leads to the war. She had been the lover of the Trojan Anchises, and mother of his son Aeneas. Later, during the war, she saves Aeneas from Diomedes, who wounds her.</p>\n<p>In Book Eight of the <i>Odyssey</i>, the blind singer Demodocus tells of how Aphrodite committed adultery with Ares, the god of war. The sun-god Helios saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus's bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a net of gold. The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both. Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to laugh at the captured adulterers, but Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon had sympathy for Ares and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares's release. Humiliated, Aphrodite returned to Cyprus, where she was attended by the Charites. This narrative probably originated as a Greek folk tale, originally independent of the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Adonis\">Adonis</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Adonis was the son of Myrrha, who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus, after Myrrha's mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess. Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree, but still gave birth to Adonis.</p>\n<p>Aphrodite found the baby, and took him to the underworld to be fostered by Persephone. She returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome. Persephone wanted to keep Adonis; Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose. Adonis chose Aphrodite, and they remained constantly together.</p>\n<p>Adonis, who loved to hunt, was wounded by a wild boar, and bled to death in Aphrodite's arms. As she mourned his death, she caused anemones to grow wherever his blood fell, and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death. According to Lucian's <i>De Dea Syria</i>, the river Adonis in Lebanon ran red with blood. The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably derived from the Near Eastern legend of Ishtar and Tammuz.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Judgment_of_Paris\">Judgment of Paris</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The myth of the Judgement of Paris is mentioned briefly in the <i>Iliad</i>, but is described in depth in an epitome of the <i>Cypria</i>, a lost poem of the Epic Cycle, which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3 (kallist\u0113i, \"for the fairest\"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.</p>\n<p>The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always fully clothed. Since the Renaissance, however, western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.</p>\n<p>All three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all Asia and Europe, and Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite promised Paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth. This woman was Helen, who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple. The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Other_myths\">Other myths</span></h3>\n\n<p>In one version of the legend of Hippolytus, Aphrodite is the cause of his death. He scorned the worship of Aphrodite, preferring Artemis. Aphrodite caused his stepmother, Phaedra, to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus would reject her. This led to Phaedra's suicide, and the death of Hippolytus.</p>\n<p>Glaucus of Corinth angered Aphrodite. During the chariot race at the funeral games of King Pelias, she drove his horses mad and they tore him apart.</p>\n<p>Polyphonte was a young woman who chose virginal life with Artemis instead of marriage and children, as favoured by Aphrodite. Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately the whole family were transformed into birds of ill omen.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Consorts_and_children\">Consorts and children</span></h2>\n\n<ol><li>Hephaestus</li>\n<li>Ares\n<ol><li>Phobos</li>\n<li>Deimos</li>\n<li>Harmonia</li>\n<li>Adrestia</li>\n<li>The Erotes, viz.\n<ol><li>Eros</li>\n<li>Anteros</li>\n<li>Himeros</li>\n<li>Pothos</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Poseidon\n<ol><li>Rhodos</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Hermes\n<ol><li>Tyche (possibly)</li>\n<li>Hermaphroditos</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Dionysus\n<ol><li>The Charites (Graces) (possibly), viz.\n<ol><li>Thalia</li>\n<li>Euphrosyne</li>\n<li>Aglaea</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Priapus</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Zeus\n<ol><li>Tyche (possibly)</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Adonis\n<ol><li>Beroe</li>\n<li>Golgos</li>\n<li>Priapus </li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Phaethon (son of Eos)\n<ol><li>Astynoos</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Anchises\n<ol><li>Aeneas</li>\n<li>Lyrus</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Butes\n<ol><li>Eryx</li>\n<li>Meligounis + several more unnamed daughters</li>\n<li>Peitho</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol><h2><span id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\"><li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\">\n\n</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Post-classical_culture\">Post-classical culture</span></h2>\n\n<p>As one of the Twelve Olympians of the Greek pantheon and thus a major deity, worship of Aphrodite or <i>Aphrod\u00edti</i> as a living goddess is one of the more prominent devotionals in <i>Hellenismos</i> (Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism), the revival of ancient Greek religious practices in the present day.</p>\n<p>Hellenic polytheists of today celebrate their religious devotion to Aphrodite on two annual and monthly festival days. Aphrodisia is her main festival day, which is celebrated on the 4th day of <i>Hekatombaion</i> in the Attic calendar, falling in the months of July and August in the Gregorian calendar, depending on the year. Adonia, a joint festival of Aphrodite and her partner Adonis, is celebrated on the first full moon following the Northern spring equinox, often roughly as the same week the Christian festival of Easter is celebrated. The fourth day of each month is considered a sacred day of both Aphrodite and her son Eros.</p>\n<p>Devotional offerings to Aphrodite can include incense, fruit (particularly apples and pomegranates), flowers (particularly fragrant roses), sweet dessert wine (particularly <i>Commandaria</i> wine from Cyprus), and cakes made with honey.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>Hellenismos</li>\n<li>Lucifer</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Bibliography\">Bibliography</span></h3>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Theoi Project, Aphrodite information from classical literature, Greek and Roman art</li>\n<li>The Glory which Was Greece from a Female Perspective</li>\n<li>Sappho's Hymn to Aphrodite, with a brief explanation`</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aphrodite Anadyomene from Pompeii cropped.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aphrodite Heyl (2).jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aphrodite swan BM D2.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aphrodites Rock.jpg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Atuell en forma d'Afrodita en una petxina, \u00c0tica, necr\u00f2polis de Fanagoria, pin\u00ednsula de Taman.

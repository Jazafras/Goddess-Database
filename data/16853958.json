The ruler's ministers envied this exceptional relationship and hatched a plan to get rid of Mamaniya Gadhvi. They were not very successful at persuading the ruler, but they succeeded in persuading the ruler's wife queen.</p>\n<p>One day, the doorkeepers did not let him go into the palace. When Mamaniya asked for the reason, he was told that a childless man is not worthy of the king's presence. Mamaniya returned home and wanted to ask Lord Shiva for help. When Lord Shiva did not appear, he decided to give his life away as a final sacrifice. Just when he was about to kill himself, Lord Shiva appeared and took him to the Snake Kingdom - Nagaloka to see the King of Snakes - <i>Nagadev</i>.</p>\n<p>After hearing his story full of humiliation, the Nagadev's daughters decided to help too. When Mamaniya came home, with his wife he prepared, as advised by the Nagdev's daughters, eight cradles in expectation of a great event. One day eight snakes crawled into the house and Mamaniya had suddenly seven daughters and one son. One of the daughters was Khodiyar Maa.

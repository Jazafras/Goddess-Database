She is the daughter of Aether and Gaia. She is said to guard the court of Hypnos in the Underworld.</p>\n<p><i>Aergia</i> is the transliteration of the Latin Socordia, or Ignavia. She was transliterated to Greek because Hyginus mentioned her based on a Greek source, and thus can be considered as both a Greek and Roman goddess. Her opposite character is Horme, a goddess of effort.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Hyginus_Account\">Hyginus Account</span></h2>\n<p>Pseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans.

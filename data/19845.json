From the second century BC onward, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena.</p>\n<p>Following the Greek myths around Athena, she was born of Metis, who had been swallowed by Jupiter, and burst from her father's head, fully armed and clad in armor. After impregnating the titaness Metis, Jupiter recalled a prophecy that his own child would overthrow him.</p>\n<p>Fearing that their child would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole. The titaness gave birth to Minerva nonetheless and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter's body. The constant pounding and ringing gave him a headache. To relieve the pain, Vulcan used a hammer to split Jupiter's head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, whole, adult, and bearing her mother's weapons and armor.</p>\n<p>She was the virgin goddess of music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and the crafts. She is often depicted with her sacred creature, an owl usually named as the \"owl of Minerva\", which symbolised her association with wisdom and knowledge.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Worship_in_Rome_and_Italy\">Worship in Rome and Italy</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Minerva was worshipped at several locations in Rome, including most prominently as part of the Capitoline Triad, and also at the Temple of Minerva Medica, and at the \"Delubrum Minervae\", a temple founded around 50 BC by Pompey on the site now occupied by the church of <i>Santa Maria sopra Minerva</i>.</p>\n<p>The Romans celebrated her festival from March 19 to March 23 during the day which is called, in the neuter plural, Quinquatria, the fifth after the Ides of March, the nineteenth, an artisans' holiday. A lesser version, the <i>Minusculae Quinquatria</i>, was held on the Ides of June, June 13, by the flute-players, who were particularly useful to religion. In 207 BC, a guild of poets and actors was formed to meet and make votive offerings at the temple of Minerva on the Aventine Hill. Among others, its members included Livius Andronicus. The Aventine sanctuary of Minerva continued to be an important center of the arts for much of the middle Roman Republic.</p>\n<p>As <i>Minerva Medica</i>, she was the goddess of medicine and physicians. As <i>Minerva Achaea</i>, she was worshipped at Lucera in Apulia where votive gifts and arms said to be those of Diomedes were preserved in her temple.</p>\n<p>Her worship also was spread throughout the empire. In Britain, for example, she was syncretized with the local goddess Sulis, who often was invoked for restitution for theft.</p>\n<p>In <i>Fasti</i> III, Ovid called her the \"goddess of a thousand works\". Minerva was worshipped throughout Italy, and when she eventually became equated with the Greek goddess Athena, she also became a goddess of battle. Unlike Mars, god of war, she was sometimes portrayed with sword lowered, in sympathy for the recent dead, rather than raised in triumph. In Rome her bellicose nature was emphasized less than elsewhere.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Roman_coinage\">Roman coinage</span></h3>\n<p>Minerva is featured on the coinage of different Roman Emperors. She often is represented on the reverse side of a coin holding an owl and a spear among her attributes.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etruscan_Menrva\">Etruscan Menrva</span></h2>\n\n<p>Stemming from an Italic moon goddess <i>*Menesw\u0101</i> ('She who measures'), the Etruscans adopted the inherited Old Latin name, <i>*Menerw\u0101</i>, thereby calling her Menrva. It is presumed that her Roman name, Minerva, is based on this Etruscan mythology. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, war, art, schools, and commerce. She was the Etruscan counterpart to Greek Athena. Like Athena, Minerva burst from the head of her father, Jupiter (Greek Zeus), who had devoured her mother (Metis) in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent her birth.</p>\n<p>By a process of folk etymology, the Romans could have linked her foreign name to the root <i>men-</i> in Latin words such as <i>mens</i> meaning \"mind\", perhaps because one of her aspects as goddess pertained to the intellectual. The word <i>mens</i> is built from the Proto-Indo-European root <i>*men-</i> 'mind' (linked with memory as in Greek Mnemosyne/\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 and <i>mnestis</i>/\u03bc\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2: memory, remembrance, recollection, <i>manush</i> in Sanskrit meaning mind).</p>\n<p>The Etruscan Menrva was part of a holy triad with Tinia and Uni, equivalent to the Roman Capitoline Triad of Jupiter-Juno-Minerva.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Universities_and_educational_establishments\">Universities and educational establishments</span></h2>\n\n<p>As a patron goddess of wisdom, Minerva frequently features in statuary, as an image on seals, and in other forms at educational institutions.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Use_by_societies_and_governments\">Use by societies and governments</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>The Seal of California depicts the Goddess Minerva.

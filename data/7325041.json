They operate closely with Lyssa, the spirit of mad rage, frenzy, and rabies; and, like, Lyssa, are presumed to be daughters of Nyx. They are also associated with the Erinyes, the three fearsome goddesses of vengeance.</p>\n<p>They are also sometimes said (though, perhaps in jest, or as a metaphor for love's sometimes cruel nature) to have been nurses of the god Eros.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Theoi: Maniae, Greek goddesses or spirits of madness &amp; crazed frenzy</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Altes Museum - Antikensammlung 058.JPG"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Question book-new.svg"}]}

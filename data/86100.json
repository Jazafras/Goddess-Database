She appears in Irish mythology as a member of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the daughter of the Dagda and wife of Bres, with whom she had a son named Ruad\u00e1n.</p>\n<p>It has been suggested that Brigid is a continuation of the Indo-European dawn goddess. She is associated with the spring season, fertility, healing, poetry and smithcraft. <i>Cormac's Glossary</i>, written in the 10th century by Christian monks, says that Brigid was \"the goddess whom poets adored\" and that she had two sisters: Brigid the healer and Brigid the smith. This suggests she may have been a triple deity.</p>\n<p>Saint Brigid shares many of the goddess's attributes and her feast day was originally a pagan festival (Imbolc) marking the beginning of spring. It has thus been argued that the saint is a Christianization of the goddess.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Familial_relations\">Familial relations</span></h2>\n<p>She is identified in <i>Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn</i> as a daughter of the Dagda and a poet. The same passage mentions that she has two oxen, Fe and Men, that graze on a plain named after them, Femen. She also possessed the <i>king of boars</i>, Torc Triath, and Cirb, king of wethers (sheep), from whom Mag Cirb is named. The animals were said to cry out a warning and thus Brigid is considered the guardian of domesticated animals.  As the daughter of Dagda, she is also the half sister of Cermait, Aengus, Midir and Bodb Derg.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Overview\">Overview</span></h2>\n<p>In <i>Cath Maige Tuireadh</i>, Br\u00edg invents keening, a combination of weeping and singing, while mourning for her son Ruad\u00e1n, after he is slain while fighting for the Fomorians. She is credited in the same passage with inventing a whistle used for night travel.</p>\n<p>Brigid is considered the patroness of poetry, smithing, medicine, arts and crafts, cattle and other livestock, sacred wells, serpents (in Scotland) and the arrival of early spring. In the Christian era, nineteen nuns at Kildare tended a perpetual flame for the Saint, which is widely believed to be a continuation of a pre-Christian practice of women tending a flame in her honour. Her festival day, Imbolc is traditionally a time for weather prognostication:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl><dd><i>Thig an nathair as an toll</i></dd>\n<dd><i>L\u00e0 donn Br\u00ecde,</i></dd>\n<dd><i>Ged robh tr\u00ec troighean dhen t-sneachd</i></dd>\n<dd><i>Air leac an l\u00e0ir.</i></dd>\n</dl><dl><dd>The serpent will come from the hole</dd>\n<dd>On the brown Day of Br\u00edde,</dd>\n<dd>Though there should be three feet of snow</dd>\n<dd>On the flat surface of the ground.</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n<p>In her English retellings of Irish myth, Lady Augusta Gregory (Gods and Fighting Men, 1904), describes Brigit as \"a woman of poetry, and poets worshipped her, for her sway was very great and very noble. And she was a woman of healing along with that, and a woman of smith's work, and it was she first made the whistle for calling one to another through the night.\"</p>\n<p>A possible British and continental counterpart Brigantia seems to have been the Celtic equivalent of the Roman Minerva and the Greek Athena (<i>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Celtic Religion</i>), goddesses with very similar functions and apparently embodying the same concept of <i>elevated state</i>, whether physical or psychological.</p>\n<p>She is the goddess of all things perceived to be of relatively high dimensions such as high-rising flames, highlands, hill-forts and upland areas; and of activities and states conceived as psychologically lofty and elevated, such as wisdom, excellence, perfection, high intelligence, poetic eloquence, craftsmanship (especially blacksmithing), healing ability, druidic knowledge and skill in warfare. In the living traditions, whether seen as goddess or saint, she is largely associated with the home and hearth and is a favorite of both Polytheists and Catholics. A number of these associations are attested in <i>Cormac's Glossary</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Brigid_and_Saint_Brigid\">Brigid and Saint Brigid</span></h2>\n<p>In the Middle Ages, the goddess Brigid was syncretized with the Christian saint of the same name. According to medievalist Pamela Berger, Christian \"monks took the ancient figure of the mother goddess and grafted her name and functions onto her Christian counterpart,\" St. Brigid of Kildare.</p>\n<p>St. Brigid is associated with perpetual, sacred flames, such as the one maintained by 19 nuns at her sanctuary in Kildare, Ireland. The sacred flame at Kildare was said by Giraldus Cambrensis and other chroniclers to have been surrounded by a hedge, which no man could cross. Men who attempted to cross the hedge were said to have been cursed to go insane, die or be crippled.</p>\n<p>The tradition of female priestesses tending sacred, naturally occurring <i>eternal flames</i> is a feature of ancient Indo-European pre-Christian spirituality. Other examples include the Roman goddess Vesta, and other hearth-goddesses, such as Hestia.</p>\n<p>Both the goddess and saint are associated with holy wells, at Kildare and many other sites in the Celtic lands. Well dressing, the tying of clooties to the trees next to healing wells, and other methods of petitioning or honoring Brigid still take place in some of the Celtic lands and the diaspora.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Festivals\">Festivals</span></h2>\n<p>Saint Brigid's feast day is on 1 February celebrated as St Brigid's Day in the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and by the Anglican Communion. The Gaelic festival coincides with Imbolc, which is a pagan festival associated with the goddess Brigid.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Other_names_and_etymology\">Other names and etymology</span></h2>\n<p>Old Irish <i>Brigit</i> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[\u02c8bri\u029did\u02b2]</span> came to be spelled <i>Brighid</i> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[\u02c8bri\u029did\u02b2]</span> by the modern Irish period.

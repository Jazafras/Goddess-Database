{"pageid": 286047, "ns": 0, "title": "Bagalamukhi", "extract": "<p><b>Bagalamukhi</b> or <b>Bagala</b> (Devnagari: \u092c\u0902\u0917\u0932\u093e\u092e\u0941\u0916\u0940) is one of the ten mahavidyas (great wisdom goddesses) in Hinduism. Bagalamukhi Devi smashes the devotee's misconceptions and delusions (or the devotee's enemies) with her cudgel. The word <i>Bagala</i> is derived from the word <i>Valga</i> (meaning \u2013 bridle or the rein that we put in the mouth to control the movements of tongue and direction) which, became <i>Vagla</i> and then <i>Bagla</i>. The goddess has 108 different names (some others also call her by 1108 names). Bagalamukhi is commonly known as Pitambara Maa in North India, the goddess associated with yellow color or golden colour.</p>\n<p>Bagalamukhi is one of the ten forms of the wisdom goddesses, symbolising the potent female primeval force. Bagulamukhi means the back side of Shiva.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Iconography\">Iconography</span></h2>\n<p>\"Bagalamukhi\" is derived from \"Bagala\" (distortion of the original Sanskrit root \"valg\u0101\") and \"mukha\", meaning \"bridle\" and \"face\", respectively. Thus, the name means one whose face has the power to capture or control. She thus represents the hypnotic power of the Goddess. Another interpretation translates her name as \"Kalyani\".In Kubjika Tantra there is a reference to yet another interpretation of the meaning of the name \u2018Bagala\u2019. In the initial chapter of the text there is a verse \u2013 \u2018Bakare Baruni Devi Gakare Siddhida Smrita. Lakare Prithivi Chaiba Chaitanya Prakrirtita\u2019 (\u2018Ba\u2019, the first letter of the name \u2013 \u2018Bagala\u2019, means \u2018Baruni\u2019 or \u2018She Who is filled with the intoxicating mood to vanguish the demon\u2019. \u2018Ga\u2019, the second letter, means \u2018She Who grants all kinds of divine powers or siddhis and successes to human beings\u2019. \u2018La\u2019, the third letter, means \u2018She Who is the foundation of all kinds of sustaining powers in the world like the earth and is Consciousness Herself\u2019.</p>\n<p>Bagalamukhi has a golden complexion and her dress is yellow. She sits in a golden throne in the midst of an ocean of nectar full of yellow lotuses. A crescent moon adorns her head. Two descriptions of the goddess are found in various texts: the <i>Dwi-Bhuja</i> (two-handed), and the <i>Chaturbhuja</i> (four-handed). The Dwi-Bhuja depiction is the more common, and is described as the <i>Soumya</i> or milder form. She holds a club in her right hand with which she beats a demon, while pulling his tongue out with her left hand. This image is sometimes interpreted as an exhibition of <i>stambhana</i>, the power to stun or paralyse an enemy into silence. This is one of the boons for which Bagalamukhi's devotees worship her. Other Mahavidya goddesses are also said to represent similar powers useful for defeating enemies, to be invoked by their worshippers through various rituals.</p>\n<p>Bagalamukhi is also called <i>Pitambaradevi</i> or <i>Brahmastra Roopini</i> and she turns each thing into its opposite. She turns speech into silence, knowledge into ignorance, power into impotence, defeat into victory. She represents the knowledge whereby each thing must in time become its opposite. As the still point between dualities she allows us to master them. To see the failure hidden in success, the death hidden in life, or the joy hidden in sorrow are ways of contacting her reality. Bagalamukhi is the secret presence of the opposite wherein each thing is dissolved back into the Unborn and the Uncreated.</p>\n<p>In \u2018Bagalamukhistotratram\u2019, a part of \u2018Rudrayamala\u2019 (a famous Tantra work), there are hymns in praise of the powers of Goddess Bagalamukhi \u2013 \u201cVadi Mukati Rankati Kshitipatirvaishwanarah Sheetati Krodhi Samyati Durjanah Sujanati Khsipranugah Khanjati. Garvi Khanjati Sarvaviccha Jarati Tvanmantrinaamantritah Srinitye Baglamukhi Pratidinam Tubhyam Namah \u201c(By the effect of Your Mantra good conversationalists become speechless; rich become beggars; devastating fire gets cooled. The anger of the angry person is removed; an evil minded person becomes good. The quick moving person becomes crippled. The conceit of the conceited person is reduced. Knowledgeable person nearly becomes a fool. Salutations to the compassionate Bagalamukhi!)</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Legend\">Legend</span></h2>\n\n<p>The reference behind the origin of Goddess Bagalamukhi is found in Svatantra Tantra. Once upon a time, a huge storm erupted over the Earth. As it threatened to destroy whole of the creation, all the gods assembled in the Saurashtra region. Goddess Bagalamukhi emerged from the 'Haridra Sarovara', and appeased by the prayers of the gods, calmed down the storm. You can see replica of 'Haridra Sarovara', as described in scriptures, at Peetambara Peetham, Datia, Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Worship\">Worship</span></h2>\n\n<p>Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati is considered to be the center of Tantricism, where there is the presence of temples dedicted to the ten Mahavidyas.

In this version of the myth (lines 60\u2013105), Hesiod expands upon her origin, and moreover widens the scope of the misery she inflicts on mankind. Pandora brings with her a jar or, in most stories, a box containing \"burdensome toil and sickness that brings death to men\" (91\u201392), diseases (102) and \"a myriad other pains\" (100). Prometheus had \u2013 fearing further reprisals \u2013 warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus. But Epimetheus did not listen; he accepted Pandora, who promptly scattered the contents of her jar. As a result, Hesiod tells us, \"the earth and sea are full of evils\" (101). One item, however, did not escape the jar (96\u201399), hope:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hesiod does not say why hope (<i>elpis</i>) remained in the jar. The implications of Elpis remaining in the jar were the subject of intense debate even in antiquity.</p>\n<p>Hesiod closes with this moral (105): \"Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus.\"</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Namesakes\">Namesakes</span></h2>\n<p>The asteroid 59 Elpis is named for her.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<p><b>Notes</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Citations</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Bibliography</b></p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</span></h2>\n<ul><li>West, M.

She is one of the most popular and venerated orishas.</p>\n<p>Oshun is a Nigerian Yoruba deity of the river and fresh water, luxury and pleasure, sexuality and fertility, and beauty and love.

The other males that were sent began the work and ignored \u1ecc\u1e63un. \u1ecc\u1e63un gathered the women and protested the blatant disrespect by forming Iyami Aje, a band of women endowed with special power. The men failed miserably and when they inquired to Olodumare as to why they weren't succeeding, Olodumare informed them that nothing can be done with out \u1ecc\u1e63un. Anything they attempt to do without women will fail. The male irunmole hurried to beg \u1ecc\u1e63un to join them.</p>\n<p>Oshun is said to have gone to a drum festival one day and to have fallen in love with Shango. Since that day, Shango has been married to Oba, Oya, and Oshun, though Oshun is said to be his principal wife. Other stanzas in the Ifa Literary Corpus say that she was also married to Orunmila, the Orisha of Wisdom and Divination.</p>\n<p>Oshun is the orisha of the river.

It is her task to ensure that souls who are ready to be reincarnated do not remember their previous life or their time in hell.</p>\n<p>To this end she collects herbs from various earthly ponds and streams to make her Five Flavored Tea of Forgetfulness (simplified Chinese: <span lang=\"zh-Hans\" xml:lang=\"zh-Hans\">\u8ff7\u9b42\u6c64</span>; traditional Chinese: <span lang=\"zh-Hant\" xml:lang=\"zh-Hant\">\u8ff7\u9b42\u6e6f</span>; Wade\u2013Giles: <i><span lang=\"zh-Latn-wadegile\" xml:lang=\"zh-Latn-wadegile\">Mi-hun-t'ang</span></i>; literally: \"waters of oblivion\"). This is given to each soul to drink before they leave Diyu. The brew induces instant and permanent amnesia, and all memory of other lives is lost.</p>\n<p>Having been purged of all previous sins and knowledge, the dead spirit is sent to be reborn in a new earthly incarnation, and the cycle begins again.</p>\n<p>Occasionally people are able to avoid drinking the brew, resulting in past life memories surfacing in children.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Godchecker entry on Meng Po</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Guanyu-1.jpg"}]}

{"pageid": 86077, "ns": 0, "title": "Banba", "extract": "<p>In Irish mythology, <b>Banba</b> (modern spelling: <b>Banbha</b>, pronounced <span>[\u02c8b\u02e0an\u02e0\u0259v\u02e0\u0259]</span>), daughter of Ernmas of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, is a patron goddess of Ireland.</p>\n<p>She was part of an important triumvirate of patron goddesses, with her sisters, \u00c9riu and F\u00f3dla. According to Seathr\u00fan C\u00e9itinn she worshipped Macha, who is also sometimes named as a daughter of Ernmas. The two goddesses may therefore be seen as equivalent. C\u00e9itinn also refers to a tradition that Banbha was the first person to set foot in Ireland before the flood, in a variation of the legend of Cessair.</p>\n<p>In the \u2018Tochomlad mac Miledh a hEspain i nErind: no Cath Tailten\u2019, it is related that as the Milesians were journeying through Ireland, \u2018they met victorious Banba among her troop of faery magic hosts\u2019 on Senna Mountain, the stony mountain of Mes. A footnote identifies this site as Slieve Mish in Chorca Dhuibne, County Kerry. The soil of this region is a non-leptic podzol [1]. If the character of Banbha originated in an earth-goddess, non-leptic podzol may have been the particular earth-type of which she was the deification.</p>\n<p>The L\u00c9 Banba (CM11), a ship in the Irish Naval Service (now decommissioned), was named after her.</p>\n<p>Initially, she could have been a goddess of war as well as a fertility goddess.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Triskele-Symbol-spiral.svg"}]}

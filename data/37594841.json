{"pageid": 37594841, "ns": 0, "title": "Shesmetet", "extract": "<p><b>Shesmetet</b> <i>(\u0161sm.t.t)</i> is an ancient Egyptian goddess. She was mentioned in the <i>Pyramid Texts</i> and was usually referred to as the deceased's mother. She was depicted as a lion or a woman with a lion's head, and thus was sometimes considered a form of Sekhmet or Bastet, but one of her epithets \u2013 \"Lady of Punt\" \u2013 differentiates her from them and may refer to a possible African origin. Her name comes from <i>shesmet,</i> a sash decorated with beads, which appears on the depictions of Old Kingdom rulers and the god Sopdu.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Benign symmetric lipomatosis</li>\n</ul>", "images": [{"ns": 6, "title": "File:Aker.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Ancient Egypt Wings.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Djed.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Kheper.svg"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Pyramidi aavikolla.png"}, {"ns": 6, "title": "File:Symbol book class2.svg"}]}

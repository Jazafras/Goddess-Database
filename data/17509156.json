It is generally thought to depict a corpulent and fertile Mother Goddess in the process of giving birth while seated on her throne, which has two hand rests in the form of feline (leopard or panther) heads. The statuette, one of several iconographically similar ones found at the site, is associated to other corpulent prehistoric goddess figures, of which the most famous is the Venus of Willendorf.</p>\n<p>It is a neolithic sculpture shaped by an unknown artist, and was completed sometime about 6000 BC. It was unearthed by archaeologist James Mellaart in 1961 at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, Turkey. When it was found, its head and hand rest of the right side were missing. The current head and the hand rest are modern replacements. The sculpture is at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara, Turkey.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>List of Stone Age art</li>\n<li>Venus figurines</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Mellaart, James\u00a0: <i>\u00c7atal H\u00fcy\u00fck, A Neolithic Town in Anatolia</i>, London, 1967</li>\n<li>Guide book of \"The Anatolian Civilizations Museum\"</li>\n<li>Lecture of Dr. R.
